## 4.1 Introduction to Project Management
### When, Why, and What?
- **Project Management** is essential to ensure that projects are delivered on time, within budget, and meet the desired objectives.
- Software projects are **unique** and involve **conflicting goals** with **limited resources**.
  
### Key Functions of Project Management:
1. **Planning**: Break down projects into tasks and allocate resources.
2. **Organization**: Assign roles and responsibilities.
3. **Staffing**: Recruit and motivate the right team members.
4. **Directing**: Lead the team effectively.
5. **Monitoring**: Track progress and adjust plans accordingly.


## 4.2 Planning and Monitoring
### Tasks and Milestones
- **Tasks** should be broken down into smaller subtasks, each with an **estimated duration**.
- **Milestones** are verifiable goals indicating task completion. They are essential for tracking progress.

### PERT Charts
- **PERT (Program Evaluation and Review Technique)**: Useful for **task dependencies** and **critical path analysis**.
- **Critical Path**: The sequence of tasks that determines the project’s completion time.

### Gantt Charts
- **Gantt charts** manage **time** and **resource allocation**, making it easy to visualize task durations and overlaps.
- Use them to track project progress and optimize **resource usage**.
- **Not** for **task interdependencies**

## 4.3 Risk Management
### Risk and Uncertainty
- Address **known knowns** (what you know), **known unknowns** (what you are aware of but unsure about), and **unknown unknowns** (what you don't foresee).
- Plan for risks early by tackling **critical risks** and setting **achievable milestones**.

### Calculating Risks
- Estimate task durations using **Optimistic Time (OT)**, **Likely Time (LT)**, and **Pessimistic Time (PT)**.
- Use **Critical Path Analysis** to identify where delays are most likely to occur.

## 4.4 Resource Allocation
### Allocating Resources
- **Staffing**: Assign team members based on required skills. Allocate tasks according to their expertise to optimize productivity.
- Gantt charts can be adjusted to ensure **smooth resource distribution** over time.

### Dealing with Delays
- Delays are common and must be anticipated. Consider options like:
  - Adding experienced staff for **non-critical tasks**.
  - Prioritizing important functionality.
  - Extending deadlines when necessary.

## 4.5 Monitoring Techniques
### Earned Value Analysis
- **Earned Value (EV)** methods help track task completion:
  - **0/100 Technique**: 0% credit until a task is completed.
  - **50/50 Technique**: 50% credit when a task is started and 100% upon completion.
  - **Milestone Technique**: Track progress using intermediate goals.
  
### Monitoring Progress
- Use **Slip Lines** and **Timeline Charts** to visualize the completion of tasks and adjust schedules accordingly.

## 4.6 Team Structures and Leadership
### Belbin’s Team Roles
- **Action-Oriented Roles**: Shaper, Implementer, Completer/Finisher.
- **People-Oriented Roles**: Coordinator, Team Worker, Resource Investigator.
- **Thought-Oriented Roles**: Plant, Monitor-Evaluator, Specialist.
  
### Myers-Briggs Type Inventory (MBTI)
- Understanding team member personalities helps in forming balanced teams.

### Team Structures
- **Hierarchical Teams**: Best for well-defined projects.
- **Decentralized Teams**: Better for exploratory work.

## 4.7 Agile and Scrum
### Scrum Framework
- **Sprint Reviews**: Regular checkpoints to evaluate the progress.
- **Definition of Done**: A checklist to ensure that all work meets quality standards.

### Scaling Scrum
- Use **Scrum of Scrums** and **component/feature teams** to manage larger projects.

## 4.8 Conclusion
- The goal of project management is not about creating a perfect plan but about detecting deviations early and making necessary adjustments.

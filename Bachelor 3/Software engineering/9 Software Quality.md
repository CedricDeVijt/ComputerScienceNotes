## 9.1: Introduction to Software Quality
### Overview
- **Software Quality** involves ensuring software meets specified requirements and delivers value.
- Attributes of software are divided into:
  - **Internal Attributes**: Derived from code and design.
  - **External Attributes**: Assessed during the system's operation.
### Importance
- High-quality software impacts:
  - Personal safety (e.g., autopilot systems).
  - Financial stakes (e.g., Y2K lawsuits).
  - Corporate success or failure.

## 9.2: Quality Attributes
### Types of Quality Attributes
1. **Correctness**: Adherence to specifications.
2. **Reliability**: The probability of the software functioning without failure for a defined period.
3. **Robustness**: Reasonable behavior in unexpected conditions.
4. **Efficiency**: Optimal use of resources like time and memory.
5. **Usability**: Ease of use for users.
6. **Maintainability**: Ease of making changes or updates.
### Product vs. Process Attributes
- **Product Attributes**: Delivered to customers (e.g., portability, usability).
- **Process Attributes**: Ensure quality during development (e.g., productivity, visibility).
### Internal vs. External Attributes
- **Internal**: Derived from the description (e.g., code structure).
- **External**: Derived from system behavior in use.

## 9.3: Quality Models
### Hierarchical Quality Model
- Quality is defined by attributes like:
  - **Portability**
  - **Maintainability**
  - **Usability**
  - **Efficiency**
  - **Reliability**

## 9.4: Quality Control and Reviews
### Quality Control Assumption
- **Goal**: Deliver products on time and within budget while ensuring quality.
### Quality Plan
- Components:
  1. Desired product qualities and assessment methods.
  2. Applicable organizational standards.
  3. Quality assessment processes.
### Types of Reviews
1. **Technical Reviews**: Focused on error detection and compliance with standards.
2. **Progress Reviews**: Ensure alignment with plans, budgets, and milestones.
### Review Best Practices
- Focus on the product, not the producer.
- Use predefined checklists.
- Limit participants and preparation time.

## 9.5: Quality Standards
### ISO 9000 and ISO 9001
- **ISO 9000**: International standards for quality management.
- **ISO 9001**: Applicable to all industries, detailing quality system requirements.
### Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI)
- **Levels**:
  1. Initial (Ad Hoc)
  2. Managed (Repeatable)
  3. Defined
  4. Quantitatively Managed
  5. Optimizing
- **Core Process Areas**: Include project planning, risk management, and organizational performance.

## 9.6: Quality in Agile Development
### Continuous Improvement in Scrum
- Key events like sprint reviews and retrospectives help refine processes.
- Common retrospective models:
  - **KALM (Keep-Add-Less-More)**
  - **DAKI (Drop-Add-Keep-Improve)**

## 9.7: Code Standards and Maintenance
### Key Practices
- Adhere to coding conventions (e.g., Java Code Conventions).
- Focus on maintainability through repairability and adaptability.
### Maintenance Costs
- **Adaptive**: 18%
- **Perfective**: 65%
- **Corrective**: 17%

## Key Points to Remember
- **Software Quality** ensures the software meets functional and non-functional requirements.
- Internal attributes (like maintainability) impact external attributes (like reliability).
- **Quality plans** are essential for structured assessment and improvement.
- **ISO 9001** and **CMMI** provide frameworks but require careful adaptation to specific contexts.
- Reviews supplement but do not replace testing.

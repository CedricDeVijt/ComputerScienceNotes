## 1.1 Software Engineering

### Why & What:

- **Product vs. Process:**
  - **Product:** What is delivered to the customer.
  - **Process:** Activities leading to the product, involving iterative and incremental development to manage risks.

### Correctness & Traceability:

- **Correctness:** Building the product right (Verification) and building the right product (Validation).
- **Traceability:** Ability to track relationships between requirements and product components.

## 1.2 Software Process

### Key Activities:

- **Requirements Collection**
- **Analysis** (defining "what")
- **Design** (defining "how")
- **Implementation**, **Testing**, **Maintenance**, and **Quality Assurance**

### Development Models:

- **Waterfall Model:**
  - Step-by-step process.
  - **Limitations:** Unrealistic for large projects, hard to manage changes, and late delivery of working versions.

- **Iterative and Incremental Development:**
  - **Iterative:** Reworking to improve.
  - **Incremental:** Small, tangible steps to produce early results.

### Sample Processes:

- **Unified Process, Spiral Model, Agile Development (XP, Scrum)**

## 1.3 Software Product

### Unified Modeling Language (UML):

- **Usage:** Standardized notation for modeling software systems, useful for managing complexity and supporting lifecycle processes.

## 1.4 Why Software Engineering?

- Questions to consider:
  - Where do the requirements come from?
  - How do we validate and verify the specifications?
  - How do we adapt to changes?
  - **Teamwork:** Managing communication and scale challenges in multi-person projects.

### Definitions and Issues:

- **"State of the art"**: Constantly evolving, demands **life-long learning**.
- **Teamwork** and **Multi-Version Development**: Software must evolve continuously.

## 1.5 Product and Process

### Key Differences:

- **Product:** System delivered to the customer.
- **Process:** Activities to create the product.

### Evaluation Criteria:

- **Validation (Correctness):** Are we building the right product?
- **Verification:** Are we building the product correctly?

## 1.6 Risk Analysis and Management

### Risk Types:

- **Project Risks:** E.g., staffing risks.
- **Technical Risks:** E.g., new technology.
- **Business Risks:** E.g., market demand uncertainty.

### Risk Assessment Process:

- **Risk Identification, Projection (Estimation), Assessment**
- **Impact and Likelihood:** Measured on scales to prioritize risks.

### Example: Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA)

- Identify potential failure modes, their effects, causes, and criticality to manage risk effectively.

## 1.7 Prototyping

- **Purpose:** To test, explore, or validate a hypothesis to reduce risks.
- **Types:**
  - **Exploratory Prototype (Throwaway):** To validate requirements or explore design choices.
  - **Evolutionary Prototype:** Evolving into the final product through iterations.

## 1.8 Agile Development

### Agile Manifesto Values:

- **Individuals & Interactions > Processes & Tools**
- **Working Software > Comprehensive Documentation**
- **Customer Collaboration > Contract Negotiation**
- **Responding to Change > Following a Plan**

### eXtreme Programming (XP):

- **Key Principles:**
  - **Fine Scale Feedback:** Pair programming, test-driven development.
  - **Continuous Process:** Continuous integration, refactoring.
  - **Shared Understanding:** Collective code ownership, simple design.
  - **Programmer Welfare:** Sustainable pace.

## 1.9 Scrum Process

### Key Concepts:

- **Sprint:** 2-4 week period to create a working product increment.
- **Daily Stand-up Meetings**

### Roles in Scrum:

- **Product Owner:** Prioritizes the backlog.
- **Scrum Master:** Facilitator.
- **Development Team:** 5-9 members responsible for increment delivery, **self-organizing**.

### Planning and Monitoring:

- **Task Points, Sprint Backlog, and Poker Planning**

# 1.10 Unified Modeling Language (UML)

### History and Evolution:

- **First Generation:** Booch, OMT.
- **Second Generation:** Fusion of proven ideas.
- **Third Generation:** Unified Modeling Language for a consistent and adaptable notation system.

### Static UML:

- **Classes and Associations:**
  - Represent relationships, aggregation, and composition.
  - **Generalization** represents inheritance.

### Dynamic UML:

- **Sequence Diagrams:** Show object interactions over time.
- **Collaboration Diagrams:** Represent relationships with messages between objects.

An in-depth history of iterative and incremental development (IID) in software engineering, which is foundational to modern agile methods. It highlights how IID is not a new concept but dates back several decades, with roots in early quality improvement methods like Walter Shewhart's "plan-do-study-act" cycles from the 1930s.

Key milestones in IID history include:

1. **Pre-1970s Origins**: Early contributions by Walter Shewhart and W. Edwards Deming set the stage for iterative cycles in quality improvement. The X-15 jet program in the 1950s and NASA’s Project Mercury in the 1960s used IID, indicating that even mission-critical projects utilized incremental approaches successfully.

2. **1960s to 1970s Developments**: In the 1960s, IBM and several other major projects documented the use of IID, with Brian Randell and F.W. Zurcher’s 1968 report explicitly describing and recommending iterative development. Gerald M. Weinberg also noted the prevalence of incremental development as early as 1957, with practices like test-first development similar to modern Extreme Programming (XP).

3. **Royce and Waterfall Misinterpretations**: In 1970, Winston Royce's paper was initially seen as supporting the waterfall model, but Royce actually proposed a more iterative approach. Despite this, the paper's simplified depiction of software development led to the proliferation of the waterfall model, which many now recognize as inadequate for handling complex projects.

4. **Evolution in the 1970s and 1980s**: Notable implementations of IID occurred at IBM Federal Systems Division (FSD), which used iterative processes for projects like the command and control system of the Trident submarine. TRW also used IID for the Army Site Defense project, while Harlan Mills and Vic Basili's iterative enhancement model became prominent.

5. **Formalization and Growth in the 1980s**: During this decade, the Cleanroom software engineering method and Barry Boehm’s "Spiral Model" emerged, further formalizing IID practices. Key thought leaders like Frederick Brooks (famous for "No Silver Bullet") emphasized the importance of iterative, evolutionary approaches over the rigid waterfall model.

6. **1990s to Present - Agile and Modern IID**: The 1990s saw increased adoption and formalization of IID through methods like the Rational Unified Process (RUP), Scrum, XP, and Feature-Driven Development (FDD). The "Agile Manifesto" in 2001 brought together a set of principles that all emphasized the importance of iterative, collaborative, and customer-focused development.

The document explores the concept of software development as a process of knowledge acquisition rather than the production of a tangible product. Armour argues that software should be seen as a medium for storing active knowledge, distinct from traditional forms of knowledge storage like DNA, brains, hardware, and books.

Here is a detailed explanation of the key ideas presented:

### **Software Development as Knowledge Acquisition**
Armour challenges the traditional view of software as a product, suggesting instead that it is a dynamic medium for storing knowledge. The actual product is the knowledge embedded in the software, which makes building software more about acquiring and understanding knowledge than just coding. Writing code is a way to capture both correct ("knowledge") and incorrect ("unknowledge") information, and the true complexity lies in understanding what needs to be built.

### **Hacking as an Example of Knowledge Acquisition**
In a "hacking" scenario, the development begins without structured knowledge acquisition. As code is written, certain aspects are validated, which helps differentiate between what works (knowledge) and what doesn't (unknowledge). This approach, while it may eventually produce a working system, often leaves behind remnants of incorrect assumptions—called "footprints of unknowledge"—making the code less clean and more difficult to maintain. Hacking emphasizes that software development involves deriving knowledge iteratively rather than producing perfect code from the start.

### **Prototyping and the Purpose of Development**
Prototyping is highlighted as an intentional approach to acknowledge software development as a knowledge-gathering process. It focuses on learning about what the system needs to do rather than immediately creating a finished product. The code generated in the prototyping stage is intended to be rewritten to cleanly represent the acquired knowledge, rather than shipped as is.

### **The Five Orders of Ignorance**
Armour introduces the concept of the **Five Orders of Ignorance**, which are used to describe different levels of understanding and ignorance in software development. These levels are:

1. **0th Order Ignorance (0OI): Lack of Ignorance**
   - This is when you know something and can demonstrate it. For example, successfully building a working system shows you have 0OI regarding that knowledge.

2. **1st Order Ignorance (1OI): Lack of Knowledge**
   - You are aware that you don't know something. For instance, knowing you can't speak Russian is 1OI, and you can resolve it by taking appropriate action to learn.

3. **2nd Order Ignorance (2OI): Lack of Awareness**
   - This occurs when you don’t know that you don’t know something. It represents an unawareness of your ignorance, which can be the root of many issues in project estimation, unexpected challenges, and rework during system development.

4. **3rd Order Ignorance (3OI): Lack of Process**
   - This is when you don’t know how to determine what you don’t know. If you lack a way to discover unknowns, you may struggle with identifying gaps in knowledge that are critical to the project. Software methodologies serve as 3OI processes, helping expose areas of ignorance but not providing specific solutions.

5. **4th Order Ignorance (4OI): Meta Ignorance**
   - This is the ignorance of the existence of the Five Orders of Ignorance itself. Once someone is aware of the framework, they no longer possess 4OI.

### **Implications for Software Development**
The application of the Five Orders of Ignorance provides insight into the complexity of software development:

- **2OI and 3OI are Critical**: Most of the effort in software development goes into reducing 2OI (understanding what questions need to be asked) and utilizing 3OI processes to find those questions. This approach highlights that methodologies do not provide answers but instead help in framing the right questions.

- **The Role of Methodologies**: Software methodologies are tools for illuminating ignorance rather than directly solving problems. This can be frustrating for developers who expect methodologies to deliver straightforward answers.

- **Code as a By-product**: Ultimately, the working software is not the primary product—it's a by-product of acquiring the necessary knowledge. The primary focus should be on understanding what the system must achieve.

### **Conclusion**
Armour's perspective fundamentally reframes software development from being about code creation to focusing on knowledge management and ignorance reduction. By categorizing different forms of ignorance, developers can better understand where they stand in terms of knowledge acquisition and can apply appropriate processes to reduce uncertainty, ultimately leading to better-designed software.

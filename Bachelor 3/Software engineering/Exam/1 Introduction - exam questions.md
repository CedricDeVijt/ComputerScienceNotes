## You should know the answers to these questions:

### Why is programming only a small part of the cost of a “real” software project?

- Programming is only a small part because real software projects involve extensive activities like requirements collection, analysis, design, testing, maintenance, and quality assurance. These activities require significant time and resources beyond just writing code.

### Give a definition for “traceability”.

- Traceability is the ability to relate components of a system back to their originating requirements to predict the impact of changes.

### Explain verification and validation in simple terms.

- **Validation:** Ensures that the requirements specifications match what the customer needs. It answers the question, "Are we building the right product?"
- **Verification:** Ensures that the product meets the requirements specifications. It answers the question, "Are we building the product right?"

### Why is the “waterfall” model unrealistic? Why is it still used?

- **Completeness:** It requires customers to define all requirements upfront, which is often impractical.
- **Time:** A working version is only available at the end, leading to potential misalignment with customer expectations.
- **Idealism:** It assumes a linear process, while real projects often require iteration.
- **Change:** Adapting to changes in requirements is difficult and costly later in the process.
- **Still Used:** Popular because it is visible for upper management, easy to control project progress.

### Can you explain the difference between iterative development and incremental development?

- **Iterative Development:** Involves revisiting and refining parts of the system to improve them, often through cycles of feedback and enhancement.
- **Incremental Development:** Focuses on delivering the system in small, functional pieces, allowing for early tangible results and a running version at all times.

### List the 6 principles of extreme programming.

1. Fine-scale feedback
2. continuous process improvement
3. shared understanding
4. programmer welfare
5. coding -> first unit test then code
6. testing -> all code must have tests, acceptance tests are run often

### What is a “sprint” in the SCRUM process?

- A sprint is a time-boxed period (typically 2 to 4 weeks) during which a potentially shippable product increment is developed. Features are selected from the product backlog, and the sprint is the phase in the SCRUM process where actual programming occurs.

### How does Software Engineering differ from programming?

- Software Engineering involves a systematic, disciplined, and quantifiable approach to developing, operating, and maintaining software. Programming is just a subset, focusing on writing code.

### What is the difference between analysis and design?

- **Analysis:** Focuses on understanding and specifying what the system should do (the requirements) ("What").
- **Design:** Focuses on how the system will achieve those requirements, detailing the architecture and components ("How").

### How do you decide to stop in the spiral model?

- You stop spiraling when you've met the project's goals, minimized remaining risks, and it is no longer cost-effective to iterate further.

### How do you identify risk? How do you asses a risk? Which risks require action?

- Risks are identified using checklists, projected by likelihood and impact, and prioritized. Action is taken on high-priority risks.

### What is Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA)?

- FMEA is a systematic method for identifying potential failures in a process, product, or system, and analyzing their causes and effects to prioritize and prevent them.

### Give the three principal roles in a scrum team. Explain their main responsibilities.

- **Product Owner:** Prioritizes the product backlog.
- **Scrum Master:** Facilitates the process and removes impediments.
- **Development Team:** Delivers the product increment.

## Can you answer the following questions?

### What is your preferred definition of Software Engineering? Why?

- "State of the art of developing quality software on time and within budget" as it emphasizes both quality and real-world constraints.

### Why do we choose “Correctness” & “Traceability” as evaluation criteria? Can you imagine some others?

- Correctness ensures the product meets user needs and specifications. Traceability predicts and manages the impact of changes.

### Why is “Maintenance” a strange word for what is done during the activity?

- Maintenance involves enhancements, adapting to changes, and fixing defects, not just preserving functionality.

### Why is risk analysis necessary during incremental development?

- Incremental development exposes new risks with each increment. Early identification ensures timely mitigation.

### How can you validate that an analysis model captures users’ real needs?

- By involving users through prototyping, reviews, and feedback sessions.

### When does analysis stop and design start?

- Analysis stops when the "what" is fully understood; design starts to define "how."

### When can implementation start?

- After completing sufficient design to provide clarity on system functionality and architecture.

### Can you compare the Unified Process and the Spiral Model?

- Both are iterative, but the Spiral Model emphasizes risk management, while the Unified Process is more structured with defined phases.

### Can you explain the values behind the Agile Manifesto?

- Focus on individuals and interactions, working software, customer collaboration, and responding to change.

### Can you identify some synergies between the techniques used during extreme programming?

- Techniques like pair programming, test-driven development, and small releases reinforce quality, communication, and iterative learning.

### Can you explain how the different steps in the scrum process create a positive feedback loop?

- Regular reviews, retrospectives, and planning allow teams to learn and improve continuously.

### How does scrum reduce risk?

- By delivering increments early and often, ensuring transparency, and promoting adaptability to changes.

### Is it possible to apply Agile Principles with the Unified Process?

- Yes, Agile's iterative nature and focus on adaptability align with Unified Process practices.

### Did the UML succeed in becoming the Universal Modeling Language? Motivate your answer.

- Partially. UML is widely used but not universally adopted, as some industries prefer tailored modeling techniques.

## You should know the answers to these questions

### Name 3 items from the code of ethics and provide a one-line explanation.

- **Public Interest**: Act consistently with the public interest to ensure societal welfare.
- **Client and Employer**: Prioritize the best interests of clients and employers within the bounds of the public good.
- **Product**: Strive to produce high-quality software that meets professional standards.

### If you are an independent consultant, how can you ensure that you will not have to act against the code of ethics?

Include a clause in contracts that allows termination if compliance with the code of ethics is compromised.

### What would be a possible metric for measuring the amount of innovation of a manufacturing company?

The number of products in the portfolio that are younger than five years.

### Explain the 2 main steps of test amplification: input amplification and assertion amplification

- **Input Amplification**: Modifies the test setup by injecting boundary conditions and new states to explore untested paths.
- **Assertion Amplification**: Generates assertions by observing runtime behavior to verify more properties of the object.

## When you chose the “No Silver Bullet” paper

### What’s the distinction between essential and accidental complexity?

- **Essential Complexity**: Inherent to the nature of software, involving abstract, precise concepts like algorithms and data.
- **Accidental Complexity**: Arises from current tools and techniques used to implement software.

### Name 3 reasons why the building of software is essentially a hard task? Provide a one-line explanation.

- **Complexity**: High interdependence and numerous states in software.
- **Conformity**: Interfaces must align with arbitrary, changing external systems.
- **Changeability**: Software must frequently evolve with new demands.

### Why is “object-oriented programming” no silver bullet?

While it improves design, it primarily removes accidental complexities without addressing the inherent complexity of software.

### Why is “program verification” no silver bullet?

It can ensure correctness relative to specifications but does not eliminate specification errors or the cost of verification itself.

### Why are “components” a potential silver bullet?

Reusable components can significantly reduce development time by allowing pre-built, tested modules to be assembled rather than coded from scratch.

## You should know the answers to these questions
### Can you give three possible problems of metrics usage in software engineering? How does the measurement theory address them?
### What’s the distinction between a measure and a metric?
### Can you give an example of a direct and an indirect measure?
### What kind of measurement scale would you need to say “A specification error is worse than a design error”? And what if we want to say “A specification error is twice as bad as a design error?”
### Explain the need for a calibration factor in Putnam’s model.
### Fill in the blanks in the following sentence. Explain briefly, based on the Putnam’s model. If you want to finish earlier (= decrease scheduled time), you should ... the effort ... .
### Give three metrics for measuring size of a software product.
### Discuss the main advantages and disadvantages of Function Points.
### What does it mean for a coupling metric not to satisfy the representation condition?
### Can you give 3 examples of impreciseness in Lines of Code measurements?

## You should be able to complete the following tasks
### Given a set of use cases (i.e. your project) calculate the use case points.
### Given a set of user stories, perform a poker planning session.

## Can you answer the following questions?
### During which phases in a software project would you use metrics?
### Why is it so important to have “good” product size metrics?
### Can you explain the two levels of calibration in COCOMO (i.e. C & S vs. M)? How can you derive actual values for these parameters?
### Can you motivate why in software engineering, productivity depends on the scheduled time? Do you have an explanation for it?
### Can you explain the cone of uncertainty? And why is it so relevant to cost estimation in software projects?
### How can you decrease the uncertainty of a project bid using Putnam’s model?
### Why do we prefer measuring Internal Product Attributes instead of External Product Attributes during Quality Control? What is the main disadvantage of doing that?
### You are a project manager and you want to convince your project team to apply algorithmic cost modeling. How would you explain the technique?
### Where would you fit coupling/cohesion metrics in a hierarchical quality model like ISO 9126?
### Why are coupling/cohesion metrics important? Why then are they so rarely used?
### Do you believe that “defect density” says something about the correctness of a program? Motivate your answer?

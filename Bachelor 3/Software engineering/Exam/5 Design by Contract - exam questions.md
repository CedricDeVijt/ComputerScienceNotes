### What’s the weakest possible condition in logic terms? And the strongest?
### If you have to implement an operation on a class, would you prefer weak or strong conditions for pre- and postcondition? And what about the class invariant?
### If a subclass overrides an operation, what is it allowed to do with the pre- and postcondition? And what about the class invariant?
### Compare Testing and Design by contract using the criteria “Correctness” and “Traceability”.
### What’s the Liskov substitution principle? Why is it important in OO development?
### What is behavioral subtyping?
### When is a pre-condition reasonable?

## You should be able to complete the following tasks

## Can you answer the following questions?

### You’re a project manager for a weather forecasting system, where performance is a real issue. Set-up some guidelines concerning assertion monitoring and argue your choice.
### If you have to buy a class from an outsourcer in India, would you prefer a strong precondition over a weak one? And what about the postcondition?
### Do you feel that design by contract yields software systems that are defect free? If you do, argue why. If you don’t, argue why it is still useful.
### How can you ensure the quality of the pre- and postconditions?
### Why is (consumer-driven) contract testing so relevant in the context of micro-services?

## 7.1 When to Use Formal Specifications

Formal specifications are critical in scenarios where software reliability is paramount. They are particularly valuable for **high-risk systems** (e.g., medical devices, aviation software), **embedded systems** where hardware and software evolve at different rates, and **standards** defining information exchange protocols. These specifications ensure clarity, unambiguity, and completeness when integrating third-party components, which is increasingly common as companies shift from "build" to "buy" strategies. This approach reduces risks associated with evolving interfaces and ensures traceability.

### Buy vs. Build Paradigm

- **Shift to "Buy"**: Companies increasingly procure third-party components for non-core functionality, necessitating precise interface specifications.
- **Need for Formality**: Formal specifications provide unambiguous, complete descriptions to ensure compatibility and reliability across evolving components.
- **Example**: A company purchasing a database module needs a formal specification to define input/output expectations, ensuring seamless integration with in-house systems.

## 7.2 Why Formal Specifications Matter

Formal specifications enhance software quality by providing a rigorous framework for **verification** and **validation**. While high-quality software can be built without them, they are cost-effective for systems where failure is catastrophic, such as those involving human lives or critical infrastructure. They also support **design by contract**, enabling mathematical proofs of correctness and facilitating robust testing strategies. However, informal methods like reviews and testing may suffice for less critical systems.

### Cost-Benefit Analysis

- **High-Risk Systems**: Formal specifications outweigh costs in systems where reliability is critical (e.g., avionics software, as discussed in Cofer et al., 2018).
- **Business Systems**: Informal methods are often more cost-effective for information systems with lower risk profiles.
- **Standards and Protocols**: Formal specifications ensure consistent implementation across multiple systems, as seen in information exchange protocols.

## 7.3 What Are Formal Specifications?

A **formal specification** is a description of desired system properties using a model with precise **syntax** and **semantics**. Unlike informal specifications (natural language with figures) or semi-formal specifications (e.g., UML diagrams with loose semantics), formal specifications enable mathematical proofs of correctness. They focus on the "what" (desired behavior) rather than the "how" (implementation), reducing ambiguity in system design.

### Types of Specifications

- **Informal Specification**: Uses natural language, figures, and examples; prone to ambiguity.
- **Semi-Formal Specification**: Employs notations like UML with precise syntax but loose semantics (e.g., class and sequence diagrams).
- **Formal Specification**: Relies on mathematical models, enabling rigorous verification, as seen in the JDK sort method verification (de Gouw et al., 2019).

## 7.4 Design by Contract and Testing

**Design by contract** uses formal specifications to define **preconditions**, **postconditions**, and **invariants**, enabling mathematical proofs that a system meets its requirements. This approach supports **black-box testing**, generating test cases for complete coverage and identifying errors with high probability. Formal specifications also mitigate faults in specifications, though omissions remain a challenge. The **Hoare triple** `{P} S {Q}` encapsulates this, ensuring that if precondition $P$ holds, statement $S$ results in postcondition $Q$.

### Hoare Triples and Correctness

- **Partially Correct**: If $P$ is true and $S$ terminates, $Q$ holds; allows infinite loops or exceptions.
- **Totally Correct**: $P$ guarantees termination, and $Q$ holds upon termination.
- **Example**: The binary search procedure (Page 10) uses pre- and postconditions to prove correctness, ensuring the algorithm either finds the key or confirms its absence.

## 7.5 Input/Output Specifications

**Input/output specifications** embed logic assertions (preconditions, postconditions, invariants) within algorithms to verify correctness and termination. These specifications use formal notations like **universal** and **existential quantifiers** to define system behavior precisely. For instance, a binary search procedure specifies that the input array is non-empty and sorted, ensuring the output correctly indicates whether the key exists.

### Example: Binary Search Specification

- **Precondition**:
  $$
  T*{\text{LAST}} - T*{\text{FIRST}} > 0 \land \forall i, T*{\text{FIRST}} \leq i < T*{\text{LAST}}, T(i) \leq T(i+1)
  $$
  Ensures the array is non-empty and sorted.
- **Postcondition**:
  $$
  (\text{Found} \land T(L) = \text{Key}) \lor (\neg \text{Found} \land \neg \exists i, T*{\text{FIRST}} \leq i \leq T*{\text{LAST}}, T(i) = \text{Key})
  $$
  Guarantees the algorithm either finds the key or confirms it does not exist.
- **Application**: Used in verifying termination and correctness via stepwise reasoning, as shown in the binary search example (Page 10).

## 7.6 Proving Correctness

Correctness proofs aim to demonstrate that a system satisfies its postconditions given true preconditions, often using **automated theorem provers** like Dafny. These tools verify that the postcondition holds or provide counterexamples when proofs fail. For loops, correctness involves proving **termination** (via loop variants) and **invariance** (via loop invariants), ensuring the system behaves as specified.

### Binary Search Correctness Proof

- **Loop Invariant**: Maintains sorted order and key constraints during iteration.
- **Termination**: The loop terminates when `Found` is true or `Bott > Top`, as the search space shrinks with each iteration.
- **Proof Steps**: Assertions (Page 11) ensure that if the key exists, it is found; otherwise, the entire array is searched, confirming absence.

## 7.7 Weakest Precondition

The **weakest precondition** for a Hoare triple `{P} S {Q}` is the least restrictive condition $P$ that ensures $Q$ holds after executing $S$. It is computed by substituting expressions in $Q$ with the effects of $S$, denoted as $[E/x] Q$. This method is critical for verifying program correctness by identifying the minimal requirements for a desired outcome.

### Example: Weakest Precondition Calculation

- **Hoare Triple**: $\{x = 5\} x := x \* 2 \{x = 10\}$
- **Calculation**: Substitute $x _ 2$ for $x$ in the postcondition:
  $$
  [x _ 2 / x] (x = 10) = (x \* 2 = 10) \implies x = 5
  $$
- **Result**: The weakest precondition is $x = 5$, ensuring $x = 10$ after execution.

## 7.8 Loops and Invariants

For loops, correctness is proven using **loop invariants** (properties true at each iteration) and **loop variants** (monotonically decreasing functions ensuring termination). The Hoare triple $\{P\} \text{while } C \text{ do } S \{Q\}$ requires:

- **Invariant**: $P \implies I$, and $\{I \land C\} S \{I\}$.
- **Termination**: A variant $v$ decreases with each iteration, reaching zero when the loop ends.

### Example: Loop Invariant and Variant

- **Loop**: $\{\ldots\} \text{while } (x > 0) \text{ do } x := x - 1 \{x = 0\}$
- **Invariant**: $x \geq 0$, true before and after each iteration.
- **Variant**: $v = x$, decreases by 1 each iteration, ensuring termination when $x = 0$.

## 7.9 State-Based Specifications

**State-based specifications** use statecharts and sequence diagrams to model system behavior. **Sequence diagrams** describe interactions (e.g., stack operations like pop on empty/non-empty stacks), while **statecharts** define state transitions, ensuring consistency, completeness, and unambiguity. These tools are critical for modeling dynamic systems like traffic lights or stacks.

### Stack Statechart Test Cases

- **Test Case**: Initialize a stack, verify it is empty, pop it, and check for an error state (Page 41).
- **Completeness**: Every event/state pair has a defined transition (Page 38).
- **Unambiguity**: No event appears on multiple transitions from the same state.

## 7.10 Formal Verification in Practice

Formal verification applies tools like **SLAM** and **SDV** to detect bugs in real-world systems, such as 270 bugs in 140 WDM/WDF drivers (Page 45). It includes **simulation**, **testing**, and **model checking** to ensure safety, liveness, and fairness properties. The JDK sort method verification (de Gouw et al., 2019) fixed an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` by formalizing invariants, demonstrating practical benefits.

### Case Study: JDK Sort Method

- **Issue**: A low-risk bug in the `mergeCollapse` method caused an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` in TimSort implementations.
- **Fix**: Formalized invariants and verified the corrected method, ensuring robustness across multiple platforms (Page 31).

## 7.11 Correctness and Traceability

Formal specifications enable **correctness** through mathematical proofs and semi-automatic test case generation, though specification omissions remain a risk. They also support **traceability** by linking requirements to system behavior, acting as an intermediate representation. **Simulation** and **animation** of specifications serve as prototypes, revealing corner cases via counterexamples.

### Traceability Example

- **Requirement**: A traffic light must alternate colors safely.
- **Formal Specification**: A statechart ensures transitions (e.g., red to green) meet safety and liveness properties, traceable to the requirement (Page 44).

## 4.1: Introduction to AI

### What is AI About?

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is fundamentally about creating systems that can perform tasks requiring human intelligence. At its core, AI is rooted in **mathematics** and involves developing algorithms that learn patterns from data to make predictions or decisions.

**Key Example**: Predicting the price of bread over time using mathematical formulas:
$\text{Price}(x) = 1.61 + x \cdot ((2.94 - 1.61) / 20)$

### AI vs. Machine Learning (ML)

- **AI**: Broad field encompassing all efforts to make machines intelligent.
- **ML**: A subset of AI focused on systems that learn from data.

### Steps to Develop AI Functions:

1. **Define Mathematical Functions**: Combine variables to form a predictive model.
2. **Parameter Optimization**: Minimize errors using regression techniques.
3. **Leverage Model Complexity**: Learn correlations and discover patterns beyond human reasoning.

## 4.2: Generative AI and Language Models (LLMs)

### How LLMs Work

Large Language Models (LLMs) generate text by predicting the next word based on context. Key steps include:

1. **Tokenization**: Breaking down text into smaller units (e.g., "Unbelievably fantastic!" becomes "Un", "believ", "ably", "fantastic", "!").
2. **Encoding**: Representing tokens in a multi-dimensional space using embeddings.
3. **Neural Networks**: Applying attention mechanisms to consider context and predict outcomes.

**Example**: "The athlete crossed the finish line, raising their arms in _victory_."

### Challenges in Generative AI

- Requires vast computational resources (e.g., building LLAMA3 took **3 months** using **24,000 NVIDIA H100 GPUs**).
- Energy consumption: Operating such systems can consume as much energy as a small city.

## 4.3: Challenges in AI Development

### Challenge #1: Algorithm Accuracy

- Ensuring models produce reliable and unbiased results (e.g., recognizing images correctly).

### Challenge #2: Energy Consumption

- Developing sustainable AI technologies is critical due to high computational and energy demands.

### Challenge #3: Ethical Concerns

- **Bias in Data**:
  1. Training on non-representative datasets (e.g., facial recognition biased towards white males).
  2. Historical biases perpetuated in models.
  3. Unethical use cases.

## 4.4: Pitfalls in AI Deployment

### Pitfall #1: Change Management

- Organizations must adapt to AI-driven processes effectively.

### Pitfall #2: Misuse

- Using AI for unethical purposes, such as mass surveillance.

### Pitfall #3: Bias

- Ensuring fairness requires diverse datasets and team composition.

### Pitfall #4: Fear of Technology

- Misconceptions about AI (e.g., autonomous vehicles) can hinder adoption despite safety benefits.

## 4.5: Innovating Responsibly with AI

### Steps to Stay in Control:

1. Foster **teamwide AI understanding** and ethical awareness.
2. Validate models using independent teams to prevent biases.
3. Monitor **model drift** and performance changes over time.
4. Maintain **diverse teams** to bring varied perspectives.

**Action Points**:

- Regularly test and validate models.
- Ensure compliance with ethical guidelines.
- Leverage tools for bias detection and mitigation.

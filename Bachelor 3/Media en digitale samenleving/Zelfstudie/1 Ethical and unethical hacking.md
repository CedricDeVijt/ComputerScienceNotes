## 1.1 Hackers: Evolution and Classification

### Historical Context of Hacking

- **1960s–1970s (Early Hackers):**

  - Driven by ideological values (e.g., democracy, freedom of speech).
  - Focused on technical mastery, peer recognition, and playful challenges.
  - Adhered to the "hacker ethic" (sharing knowledge, distrusting authority).

- **2000s–2010s (Economic Shift):**

  - Rise of economic incentives due to the value of digital assets (e.g., data, intellectual property).
  - Emergence of cybercrime and professional hacking.

- **Modern Hackers (Post-2010s):**
  - Societal dependence on IT infrastructure (e.g., healthcare, energy grids) creates new targets.
  - New categories: state-sponsored hackers, cyber-terrorists, hacktivists.

### Taxonomy of Hackers

#### **Classification by Expertise and Legal Goals**

| **High Expertise**                        | **Low Expertise** |
| ----------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| **Legal Goals**: White hats               | –                 |
| **Illegal Goals**: Black hats             | Script kiddies    |
| **Unlegal Goals**: Grey hats, Hacktivists | True hackers      |

#### **Extended Taxonomy (Internal/External Factors)**

| **Internal**             | **External**                                  |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Resources**: Expertise | Tools (e.g., zero-days)                       |
| **Attitude**: Values     | Modus operandi (e.g., targets, collaboration) |

- **White Hats**: Legal, client-mandated penetration testers.
- **Black Hats**: Malicious intent (e.g., financial gain, sabotage).
- **Grey Hats**: Non-malicious but may bypass laws (e.g., hacktivists).
- **Script Kiddies**: Low expertise, rely on pre-built tools.

## 1.2 Ethical Hacking: Definitions and Controversies

### What is "Ethical Hacking"?

- **Common Usage**: Refers to hackers adhering to a business-friendly code of conduct.
  - Obtain written permission.
  - Protect client confidentiality.
  - Disclose vulnerabilities responsibly.
- **Certifications**: CEH (Certified Ethical Hacker) emphasizes legal compliance and trustworthiness.

### Ethical Ambiguities

- **Tension**: Business-friendly ethics vs. broader moral considerations.
  - Example: A white hat discovers client wrongdoing but must prioritize confidentiality.
- **Prima Facie vs. Ultima Facie Ethics**:
  - **Prima Facie**: Actions violating at least one ethical value (e.g., breaching privacy).
  - **Ultima Facie**: All-things-considered moral evaluation (may override business ethics).

### Competing Ethical Values

- **Three Levels of Conflict**:
  1. **Personal**: Hacker’s own moral principles (e.g., justice vs. loyalty).
  2. **Business**: Client trust and legal obligations.
  3. **Societal**: Public interest (e.g., preventing harm from cyberattacks).

## 1.3 Pragmatic Approaches to Ethical Hacking

### Codes of Conduct

- **Key Rules**:
  - Written consent for penetration testing.
  - Transparent communication of findings.
  - Avoid introducing backdoors.

### Institutional Solutions

- **Ethical Committees**:
  - Example: A European pen-test company uses an employee-elected committee to resolve ethical dilemmas.
  - Binding decisions to block projects conflicting with societal/personal ethics.

## Key Points to Remember

- **Evolution of Hackers**: From ideology-driven (1960s) to profit/society-driven (modern).
- **Taxonomies**:
  - White hats (legal), black hats (malicious), grey hats (mixed motives).
  - Script kiddies (low skill) vs. state-sponsored hackers (high resources).
- **Ethical Hacking**:
  - Prioritizes business trust but may conflict with broader ethics.
  - Requires balancing legal compliance, client loyalty, and societal good.
- **Ethical Dilemmas**:
  - Trust vs. justice (e.g., reporting client misconduct).
  - Codes of conduct alone are insufficient; institutional oversight (e.g., ethical committees) is critical.
- **Terminology**: "Ethical hacker" is misleading; "business-compliant hacker" better reflects common usage.

## 2.1 Origins in 18th-Century Europe

### The Rise of Free Press Against Monarchy

- Pre-18th century: Power centralized with monarchs and the church; dissent suppressed.
- Emergence of wealthy merchants, Protestants, and republicans demanding political influence.
- Enlightenment thinkers like **John Milton** championed freedom of speech as a liberal ideal.
- **Daniel Defoe** (author of _Robinson Crusoe_) pioneered early journalism by documenting trials and political events, aligning with anti-monarchy forces.

### Democratic Foundations and Press Freedom

- Early democracies enshrined press freedom (e.g., **First Amendment** in the U.S. Constitution).
- **Thomas Jefferson**: Prioritized newspapers over government, highlighting journalism’s role in accountability.
- Journalism became a tool for revolutionaries to challenge authority and inform citizens.

## 2.2 Evolution of Journalism’s Role

### Gatekeeping and Objectivity in Practice

- **David Manning White’s 1950s study**: Editors act as "gatekeepers," filtering news based on space, relevance, or personal bias.
- **Nick Davies’ findings (1980–2008 UK study)**: Only 12% of news stories involved original reporting; most relied on PR or recycled content.
- Commercial pressures reduce investigative journalism, prioritizing profit over public interest.

### Global Media Landscapes

- **Authoritarian regimes**: Media aligns with state agendas (e.g., Russia’s RT, China’s _Southern Weekly_).
  - _Southern Weekly_ (China): Commercially successful but censored when critical of the government (2013 protests).
- **Fox News (U.S.)**: Prioritizes political/ideological alignment (e.g., anti-vaccine rhetoric) over objectivity, driven by Rupert Murdoch’s profit motives.

## 2.3 Challenges to Democratic Journalism

### Commercialization and Resource Shortages

- Media owners prioritize profit, reducing resources for investigative reporting.
- Journalists face tight deadlines and reliance on unverified sources.

### Citizen Engagement and Media Literacy

- Citizens consume news for entertainment or social context, not just political decisions.
- **Barbie Zelizer’s critique**: Journalism’s democratic role is inconsistent; success depends on public engagement and institutional support.

## 2.4 Strengthening the Journalism-Democracy Bond

### Necessary Conditions for Impactful Journalism

1. **Accountability**: Journalists must scrutinize power structures (politicians, corporations).
2. **Institutional Support**: Governments must fund public media (e.g., subsidies for VRT in Flanders) and protect press freedom.
3. **Public Responsibility**: Citizens must value quality journalism and seek diverse sources.

### Case Study Lessons

- **Historical success**: Journalism thrived when allied with democratic movements.
- **Modern failures**: Commercialization and state control undermine democratic ideals.

## Key Points to Remember

- **Historical roots**: Journalism emerged as a counterforce to monarchy, enshrined in democratic constitutions.
- **Gatekeeping role**: Editors shape narratives, often influenced by non-journalistic factors (space, bias).
- **Commercial pressures**: Profit-driven media reduces investigative rigor (e.g., Fox News, UK press).
- **Global contrasts**: Authoritarian states use media for propaganda (RT, China’s _Southern Weekly_), yet maintain commercial viability.
- **Citizen role**: Public engagement and media literacy are critical for journalism’s democratic function.
- **Systemic solutions**: Requires collaboration between journalists, policymakers, and citizens to fund and protect independent media.

## DISTRIBUTED SYSTEMS

### A) Describe the two types of coupled logical architectures that a distributed system may follow. Indicate the strengths and weaknesses of each of these types.

In distributed systems, two primary types of coupled logical architectures are layered and object-based architectures.

**Layered Architecture:**

- In a layered architecture, the system is organized into distinct layers, each with specific responsibilities. Each layer interacts only with the layers directly above and below it.
- **Strengths:**
  - Reduced number of interfaces, dependencies
  - Easy replacement of a layer
- **Weaknesses:**
  - Possible duplication of functionality

**Object-Based Architecture:**

- In an object-based architecture, the system is organized around objects that encapsulate both data and behavior. Objects communicate with each other through method invocations.
- **Strengths:**
  - No predefined interaction pattern
  - Highly flexible
- **Weaknesses:**
  - Complex to manage and maintain

## MIDDLEWARE

### A) Indicate the main differences between Local Method Invocation and Remote Method Invocations from the point of view of the used reference, the access and the number of invocations that are required by the client machine (invoker).

Local Method Invocation and Remote Method Invocation (RMI) differ significantly in several aspects:

**Local Method Invocation:**

- **Reference:** Uses a direct reference (pointer) to the object in the same address space.
- **Access:** Direct access to the object's methods without any network overhead.
- **Invocations:** Requires a single invocation to call the method on the object.

**Remote Method Invocation:**

- **Reference:** Uses a remote object reference, which may involve a proxy or stub to access the object across process boundaries.
- **Access:** Involves network communication, which can introduce latency and requires serialization/deserialization of data.
- **Invocations:** May require multiple invocations, including those for the proxy and skeleton, to handle the remote call.

### B) Indicate what is the role of the Proxy on the Remote Method Invocation process. Indicate how the Proxy and the Skeleton are related.

In Remote Method Invocation (RMI), the Proxy and Skeleton play crucial roles in facilitating communication between the client and the remote object.

Role of the Proxy:

The Proxy acts as a local representative of the remote object, allowing the client to interact with it as if it were a local object. It is responsible for:

1. **Marshalling Requests:** The Proxy marshals the method invocation request, which includes the target object reference, method ID, and argument values.
2. **Sending Requests:** It sends the marshaled request message to the remote object, typically over a network.
3. **Unmarshalling Replies:** After receiving the response from the remote object, the Proxy unmarshals the reply and returns it to the client invoker.

Relationship between Proxy and Skeleton:

The Skeleton is the counterpart of the Proxy on the server side. It is responsible for:

1. **Receiving Requests:** The Skeleton receives the marshaled request messages sent by the Proxy.
2. **Unmarshalling Requests:** It unmarshals the request to extract the target object reference, method ID, and argument values.
3. **Executing Invocations:** The Skeleton invokes the appropriate method on the remote object using the unmarshaled data.

## SERVICE-ORIENTED ARCHITECTURES / CLOUD COMPUTING

### A) Indicate the difference between the different types of multi-tenancy.

### B) List and describe the three service models commonly used in cloud computing. Provide an example of a service following each of the three models.

## WEB SERVICES

### A) REST architectures are characterized by several architectural constraints. Explain each of the following constraints and indicate why each of them is desirable. a) Client-server model, b) Caching and c) Layering

### B) Describe five ways in which REST resources are described from the point of view of REST URI design.

## MICROSERVICES

### A) The Reactive Manifesto is characterized by four architectural traits. Describe each of these traits and indicate their importance.

### B) Indicate why containers are considered a preferable solution over virtual machines (VM) for the implementations of microservices. Indicate at least one advantages and one disadvantage of using containers.

## DISTRIBUTED STORAGE

### A) Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) have been proposed as a good structure to handle disrtibuted storage and processing. Indicate how these DAG structures are defined in the context of disrtibuted storage and processing and what are the advantages of following this type of structure.

In distributed storage and processing, DAGs are defined as network topologies where:

**Structure Definition:**

- Nodes represent storage units, processing tasks, or computational workers
- Directed edges indicate data flow, dependencies, or communication paths
- Acyclic property ensures no circular dependencies or infinite loops
- Tasks/data flow from sources to sinks in a deterministic order

**Key Advantages:**

**Dependency Management:** Clear ordering of operations prevents deadlocks and ensures tasks execute only after their prerequisites complete.

**Parallelization:** Independent branches can execute simultaneously, maximizing resource utilization and reducing overall processing time.

**Fault Tolerance:** Failed nodes can be recomputed by re-executing their dependencies without affecting the entire system.

**Scalability:** New nodes and edges can be added without breaking existing structure, enabling horizontal scaling.

**Optimization:** Schedulers can identify critical paths, optimize resource allocation, and minimize data movement between nodes.

**Data Lineage:** Clear provenance tracking for debugging, auditing, and incremental updates.

Common implementations include Apache Spark's execution plans, Apache Airflow's workflow scheduling, and blockchain technologies like IOTA's Tangle, where DAG structure enables efficient distributed consensus and processing without traditional bottlenecks.

### B) Indicate the main difference between Narrow and Wide transformation in Resilient Distributed Datasets (RDDs). DataFrames.

Narrow and wide transformations are two types of operations in Resilient Distributed Datasets (RDDs) and DataFrames in distributed computing frameworks like Apache Spark. The main difference between them lies in how they handle data partitioning and shuffling during the transformation process.

- Narrow Transformation: Required elements for computation in a single partition live in the single partition of parent RDD
- Wide Transformation: Required elements for computation in a single partition may live in many partitions of parent RDD

### B) Describe the Pipelined Random Access Memory (PRAM) consistency model. Indicate and justify whether the processes below follow the PRAM consistency model.

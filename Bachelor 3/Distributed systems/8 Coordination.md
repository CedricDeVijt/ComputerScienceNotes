## 8.1 Problem Statement & Requirements

**Critical section coordination** for N processes without shared variables.

- **Safety**: At most one process in CS at any time.
- **Liveness**: No deadlock/starvation; requests eventually granted.
- **Fairness**: Requests ordered by Lamport clocks (logical timestamps).

### Evaluation Metrics

1. **Bandwidth**: Messages per enter/leave operation.
2. **Client Delay**: Time to enter/leave (unloaded system).
3. **Synchronization Delay**: Lost time between CS exits/entries (loaded system).

## 8.2 Central Server Algorithm

**Token-based coordination via central authority**.

- **Client Flow**:
  - `enter()`: Send Request → Wait for Grant (2 messages).
  - `leave()`: Send Leave (1 message).
- **Server Flow**:
  - Grant token if free; else enqueue requests.

### Efficiency Analysis

- **Bandwidth**: 2 messages/enter, 1/leave.
- **Client Delay**: $2\delta$ (RTT for Grant).
- **Sync Delay**: $2\delta$ (server processing).

## 8.3 Ring-Based Algorithm

**Logical ring with circulating token**.

- **Token Passing**: Only token holder enters CS.
- **Safety**: Token possession guarantees exclusivity.
- **Liveness**: Token circulates indefinitely.

### Efficiency Analysis

- **Bandwidth**: Average $(N+1)/2$ messages/enter (token traversal).
- **Client Delay**: Average $N\delta/2$.
- **Sync Delay**: $(N+1)\delta/2$.

## 8.4 Ricart-Agrawala Algorithm

**Multicast-based with Lamport clocks**.

- **Process Flow**:
  1. Multicast Request($T_i, p_i$) to all.
  2. Enter CS after collecting $N-1$ Replies.
  3. Release and Reply to queued Requests.

### Safety Proof

Contradiction: Two processes in CS would require mutual Replies, violating Lamport ordering.

### Efficiency Analysis

- **Bandwidth**: $2N-1$ messages/enter (multicast + replies).
- **Sync Delay**: $\delta$ (single message round).

## 8.5 Maekawa Voting Algorithm

**Voting subsets for reduced coordination**.

- **Voting Set ($V_i$)**: Each process requires $K=\sqrt{N}$ votes.
- **Overlap Requirement**: $V_i \cap V_j \neq \emptyset$ for safety.

### Algorithm Flow

- `enter()`: Request votes from $V_i$.
- `leave()`: Release votes to $V_i$.

### Limitations

- **Deadlock Risk**: Resolved using Lamport clocks.
- **Efficiency**:
  - Bandwidth: $2K$ messages/enter, $K$/leave.
  - Sync Delay: $2\delta$.

# 8 Election Mechanisms

## 8.6 Chang-Roberts Ring Algorithm

**Elect highest-ID process via token circulation**.

- **Process Flow**:
  - Forward Election(ID) if received ID < own ID.
  - Declare self leader if token completes full circle.

### Safety & Liveness

- **Safety**: Unique IDs prevent multiple leaders.
- **Liveness**: Guaranteed in failure-free, asynchronous systems.

### Efficiency

- **Bandwidth**: $O(N)$ to $O(N^2)$ messages.
- **Turnaround Time**: $O(N\delta)$.

## 8.7 Bully Algorithm

**Timeout-based leader election with crash recovery**.

- **Process Flow**:
  1. Send Election to higher-ID processes.
  2. If no Answer, declare self leader.
  3. Broadcast Coordinator to lower IDs.

### Crash Handling

- Higher-ID processes "bully" lower IDs into submission.

### Efficiency

## More info

Coordination in distributed systems refers to the mechanisms and protocols that enable multiple independent processes, nodes, or components to work together to achieve a common goal, maintain consistency, and manage shared resources despite being geographically or logically separated. It addresses challenges like synchronization, communication, fault tolerance, and consensus in environments where nodes may fail, messages may be delayed or lost, and no single node has a complete view of the system.

### Why Coordination is Necessary

Distributed systems consist of multiple nodes (computers, servers, or processes) that communicate over a network. Coordination is critical because:

- **No Centralized Control**: Nodes operate independently without a single point of control.
- **Concurrency**: Multiple nodes may access shared resources simultaneously, risking conflicts.
- **Partial Failures**: Nodes or network links may fail, requiring mechanisms to maintain system reliability.
- **Asynchronous Communication**: Message delays and varying processing speeds complicate synchronization.
- **Consistency Requirements**: Applications often need guarantees about data consistency or task ordering across nodes.

Coordination ensures nodes agree on actions, states, or resource usage, enabling the system to function reliably and efficiently.

### Key Problems in Coordination

Coordination in distributed systems tackles several core challenges:

#### Consensus

Consensus involves nodes agreeing on a single value or decision, even in the presence of failures. It’s critical for tasks like:

- **Leader Election**: Choosing a single node to act as a coordinator (e.g., in a distributed database).
- **State Machine Replication**: Ensuring all nodes apply the same sequence of operations (e.g., in fault-tolerant systems).
- **Distributed Transactions**: Agreeing on whether to commit or abort a transaction.

**Example Algorithms**:

- **Paxos**: A robust protocol for achieving consensus in asynchronous systems with crash failures. It’s complex but ensures safety (agreement) and liveness (progress) under certain conditions.
- **Raft**: A more understandable consensus algorithm that breaks down leader election, log replication, and safety into manageable steps. Used in systems like etcd and Consul.
- **Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT)**: Handles malicious nodes or arbitrary failures (e.g., PBFT, used in blockchain systems).

#### Synchronization

Synchronization ensures that nodes perform actions in a specific order or at specific times, avoiding race conditions or inconsistent states.

- **Mutual Exclusion**: Ensures only one node accesses a shared resource at a time (e.g., a distributed lock for a shared file).
- **Event Ordering**: Guarantees that operations or messages are processed in a consistent order across nodes.
- **Time Synchronization**: Aligns clocks across nodes to coordinate time-sensitive operations.

**Techniques**:

- **Distributed Locks**: Tools like Zookeeper or Chubby provide distributed locking mechanisms.
- **Logical Clocks**: Lamport clocks or vector clocks assign timestamps to events to establish causality without relying on synchronized physical clocks.
- **Physical Clock Synchronization**: Protocols like NTP (Network Time Protocol) align node clocks, though perfect synchronization is impossible due to network delays.

#### Distributed Transactions

Coordination is needed to ensure atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability (ACID properties) across multiple nodes.

- **Two-Phase Commit (2PC)**: A protocol where a coordinator asks nodes to prepare to commit, then issues a commit or abort decision. It ensures all-or-nothing semantics but can block if the coordinator fails.
- **Three-Phase Commit (3PC)**: An extension of 2PC that reduces blocking by adding a pre-commit phase, though it’s less commonly used.
- **Saga Pattern**: Breaks transactions into smaller, independent steps with compensating actions, suitable for microservices.

#### Leader Election

Many systems require a single node to act as a leader to coordinate tasks (e.g., in Apache Kafka for partition management).

- **Bully Algorithm**: Nodes with higher IDs attempt to become the leader, sending messages to assert dominance.
- **Ring Algorithm**: Nodes pass messages in a logical ring to elect a leader.
- Tools like Zookeeper simplify leader election by providing primitives for coordination.

#### Resource Allocation

Coordination prevents conflicts when nodes compete for shared resources (e.g., CPU, storage, or network bandwidth).

- **Distributed Semaphores**: Limit concurrent access to resources.
- **Lease Mechanisms**: Grant temporary access to resources, with expiration to handle failures.

#### Fault Tolerance and Recovery

Coordination mechanisms must handle node crashes, network partitions, or message loss.

- **Heartbeats**: Nodes periodically send signals to indicate they’re alive.
- **Failure Detectors**: Identify failed nodes (e.g., using timeouts or gossip protocols).
- **Checkpointing and Logging**: Record system state to recover after failures.

### Key Coordination Mechanisms and Tools

Several protocols, algorithms, and tools facilitate coordination in distributed systems:

#### Coordination Services

- **Apache Zookeeper**: A centralized service for distributed coordination, providing primitives like distributed locks, configuration management, and leader election. It uses a consensus protocol (ZAB) to ensure consistency.
- **etcd**: A distributed key-value store used for coordination in systems like Kubernetes. It relies on Raft for consensus.
- **Consul**: Provides service discovery, configuration, and coordination for distributed systems.

#### Message Passing

- **Message Queues**: Systems like RabbitMQ, Kafka, or AWS SQS enable asynchronous communication, ensuring reliable message delivery for coordination.
- **Publish-Subscribe Models**: Nodes subscribe to events, and publishers broadcast updates (e.g., used in event-driven architectures).

#### Distributed Algorithms

- **Chandy-Lamport Snapshot**: Captures a consistent global state of a distributed system without pausing it.
- **Vector Clocks**: Track causality between events to resolve conflicts in replicated data systems (e.g., DynamoDB).
- **Gossip Protocols**: Nodes exchange state information randomly to propagate updates or detect failures (e.g., used in Cassandra).

#### CRDTs (Conflict-Free Replicated Data Types)

CRDTs allow data replication across nodes with automatic conflict resolution, reducing the need for explicit coordination. Examples include counters, sets, and maps used in systems like Redis or Riak.

### Challenges in Coordination

- **Scalability**: Coordination overhead grows with the number of nodes, impacting performance.
- **Network Partitions**: When parts of the system can’t communicate, coordination protocols must balance availability and consistency (per the CAP theorem).
- **Latency**: Network delays can slow down coordination, especially in geo-distributed systems.
- **Fault Tolerance**: Protocols must handle failures gracefully without compromising correctness.
- **Complexity**: Algorithms like Paxos are notoriously hard to implement correctly.

### CAP Theorem and Coordination

The CAP theorem states that a distributed system can only guarantee two of three properties: Consistency, Availability, and Partition Tolerance. Coordination protocols often prioritize:

- **CP Systems** (Consistency + Partition Tolerance): Sacrifice availability during partitions to ensure strong consistency (e.g., Zookeeper, etcd).
- **AP Systems** (Availability + Partition Tolerance): Allow temporary inconsistencies to remain available (e.g., Cassandra with eventual consistency).
  Coordination mechanisms like consensus or distributed transactions are critical for CP systems but may be relaxed in AP systems using eventual consistency models.

### Real-World Applications

- **Distributed Databases**: Systems like Spanner, CockroachDB, or MongoDB use coordination for consistent replication and transactions.
- **Container Orchestration**: Kubernetes uses etcd for cluster coordination, managing node states and configurations.
- **Big Data Frameworks**: Apache Spark and Hadoop use Zookeeper for task coordination and resource management.
- **Blockchain**: Coordination ensures agreement on the state of the ledger (e.g., Bitcoin uses Proof of Work, Ethereum uses BFT variants).
- **Microservices**: Tools like Consul or message queues coordinate service discovery and communication.

### Best Practices for Coordination

- **Minimize Coordination**: Use eventual consistency or CRDTs where strong consistency isn’t required to reduce overhead.
- **Leverage Existing Tools**: Use Zookeeper, etcd, or Consul instead of building custom coordination logic.
- **Handle Failures Gracefully**: Design systems to tolerate partial failures using timeouts, retries, and fallback mechanisms.
- **Monitor and Optimize**: Track coordination latency and resource usage to avoid bottlenecks.
- **Test for Partitions**: Simulate network partitions to ensure coordination protocols behave correctly.

### Trade-Offs

- **Strong vs. Eventual Consistency**: Strong consistency requires more coordination (e.g., 2PC) but ensures correctness, while eventual consistency (e.g., Dynamo) sacrifices immediate agreement for availability.
- **Centralized vs. Decentralized Coordination**: Centralized systems (e.g., Zookeeper) simplify coordination but introduce a single point of failure, while decentralized systems (e.g., gossip-based) are more resilient but harder to manage.
- **Synchronous vs. Asynchronous**: Synchronous coordination (e.g., 2PC) ensures strict ordering but blocks progress, while asynchronous coordination (e.g., message queues) improves responsiveness but risks temporary inconsistencies.

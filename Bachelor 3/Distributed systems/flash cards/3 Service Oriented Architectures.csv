"Define Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) and explain why it is considered technology-neutral.","SOA is an architectural style where the core design unit is a 'service' that exposes discrete capabilities through interfaces. It is technology-neutral because it focuses on design principles rather than implementation details, allowing services to be developed in different languages and platforms."
"Compare tightly coupled and loosely coupled architectures in distributed systems.","Tightly coupled architectures have components strongly linked, making changes difficult. Loosely coupled architectures allow easier replacement and scaling of components, improving flexibility and fault isolation."
"Explain the similarities between service orientation and object orientation.","Object orientation organizes software around classes/objects, while service orientation organizes at the process level with services. Both promote encapsulation and modularity, but services are independently deployable and distributed."
"Why was the historical 'stovepipe' system problematic for distributed computing?","It led to data silos, synchronization issues, vendor lock-in, redundancy, and integration complexity, making the system rigid and costly to maintain."
"Describe the role of middleware in a service-oriented architecture.","Middleware acts as an abstraction layer that enables communication, integration, and coordination between distributed services, hiding underlying network complexities."
"Explain the concept of service composition in SOA.","Service composition involves combining multiple discrete services into larger workflows or applications, enabling reuse and modular application design."
"Define multi-tenancy in the context of SOA and cloud computing.","Multi-tenancy is an architectural approach where a single software instance serves multiple client organizations (tenants). Each tenant shares infrastructure but may have customized data or configurations."
"Differentiate between data multi-tenancy and application multi-tenancy.","Data multi-tenancy uses the same application with different tenant-specific data. Application multi-tenancy allows tenants to configure or customize application behavior."
"Describe how SOA principles are implicitly used in cloud computing.","Cloud services expose capabilities as independent, reusable units (SaaS, PaaS, IaaS), which align with SOA principles of modularity, reusability, and service-based access."
"Explain the role of virtualization as an enabler of cloud computing.","Virtualization allows abstraction of physical hardware into virtual machines, enabling efficient resource usage, scalability, and isolation between tenants."
"Define SaaS and provide an example.","Software as a Service delivers applications over the Internet with limited configurability, automated updates, and subscription pricing. Example: Google Drive."
"Define PaaS and provide an example.","Platform as a Service offers a managed development environment with built-in scalability and limited language options. Example: Google App Engine."
"Define IaaS and provide an example.","Infrastructure as a Service provisions virtualized computing resources (VMs, storage, networking) on demand. Example: Amazon EC2."
"Compare SaaS, PaaS, and IaaS in terms of control and flexibility.","SaaS provides the least control but maximum convenience, PaaS offers moderate control with constraints on technology choices, and IaaS provides maximum control over the stack but requires more management."
"List and explain three cloud deployment models.","Public cloud: resources shared over the internet; Private cloud: dedicated resources for one organization; Hybrid cloud: combination of both for flexibility."
"Explain the concept of community clouds.","Community clouds are shared by several organizations with common concerns, such as compliance or shared infrastructure requirements."
"Describe the four cloud payment models discussed in the chapter.","Per-instance billing: pay per VM-hour; Reserved usage: upfront payment for lower rates; Bidding: dynamic pricing based on demand; Actual usage: pay exactly for consumed resources (common in PaaS)."
"Explain why containers are more efficient for service deployment than VMs.","Containers share the host OS kernel, reducing overhead and improving scalability compared to VMs, which require full OS virtualization."
"Describe the OASIS definition of SOA and its significance.","OASIS defines SOA as a paradigm for organizing and utilizing distributed capabilities across ownership domains, focusing on uniform discovery, interaction, and usage of services."
"Discuss why the term SOA is considered 'dead' but the concept is still relevant.","While the buzzword has faded, the principles of modularity, service orientation, and reuse are foundational to modern cloud and microservices architectures."

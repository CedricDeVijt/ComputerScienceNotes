"What is a Web Service, according to the W3C definition?","A Web Service is a software system designed to support interoperable machine-to-machine interaction over a network, with an interface described in a machine-processable format (e.g., WSDL) and typically communicated using SOAP or REST messages over protocols like HTTP."
"List three key benefits of using Web Services in distributed applications.","1) Loose Coupling: services exist independently and can be modified without breaking others. 2) Ease of Integration: they act as glue across applications and organizations. 3) Service Reuse: specific functionality can be coded once and reused by many consuming applications."
"Give two real-world examples of Web Services and explain their functionality.","Examples: Google Maps Directions API (provides routing instructions between locations) and Facebook Graph API (allows querying and retrieving social media content)."
"Explain what REST stands for and its origin.","REST stands for Representational State Transfer, an architectural style for distributed systems introduced by Roy Fielding in his 2000 PhD thesis. It was inspired by the principles behind HTTP and the Web."
"What is a resource in REST and how is it identified?","In REST, a resource is any item of interest (e.g., a product, user, or document) that is uniquely identified by a URI (Uniform Resource Identifier). URIs can be URLs, URNs, or both."
"Describe the role of URIs in RESTful API design. List three best practices.","URIs describe resources in REST APIs. Best practices include: (1) Use nouns, not verbs, (2) Keep them short and meaningful, (3) Make them hackable up the hierarchy (e.g., /courses/computer-science/master)."
"Explain the use of standard HTTP methods in REST and how they map to CRUD operations.","REST APIs map HTTP methods to CRUD: GET → Read, POST → Create, PUT → Update, DELETE → Delete. For example, GET /employees/21 retrieves employee 21, while DELETE /employees/21 removes it."
"Why is JSON often preferred over XML in RESTful APIs?","JSON is lightweight, human-readable, language-independent, and widely supported. Unlike XML, it is less verbose and integrates naturally with JavaScript environments, making it the default format in many REST APIs."
"Describe the REST architectural constraint of statelessness. What advantage does it provide?","Each request must contain all necessary information, and the server does not store client state. This simplifies scalability, improves reliability, and enables load balancing."
"Explain the caching constraint in REST. Why is it important?","Clients may cache responses to improve performance and reduce server load. Responses must define whether they are cacheable. Caching increases scalability and efficiency."
"Describe the layering constraint in REST. Provide an example of its use.","In REST, clients cannot tell if they are connected directly to the server or through intermediaries like proxies or load balancers. Example: a proxy server providing failover and load balancing between multiple application servers."
"What is the optional 'code-on-demand' constraint in REST and when is it used?","Code-on-demand allows servers to transfer executable code (e.g., JavaScript) to clients, extending their functionality dynamically. It is rarely required but useful for lightweight web applications."
"What does SOAP stand for and how does it differ from REST in terms of message format?","SOAP stands for Simple Object Access Protocol. Unlike REST, which can use multiple formats like JSON, SOAP strictly uses XML for message formatting."
"Describe the structure of a SOAP message.","A SOAP message has an Envelope (root element), an optional Header (extensions such as security credentials), and a Body (the main message content)."
"What is the role of WSDL in SOAP-based web services?","WSDL (Web Services Description Language) is an XML grammar that describes access endpoints, communication protocols, message formats, and operations. It enables automation of application-to-application interaction and code generation."
"Explain the SOAP processing model by naming its main communicating nodes.","The SOAP processing model defines: Initial Sender (originator), Intermediaries (e.g., proxies), and the Ultimate Receiver. Messages may pass through multiple nodes for routing, load balancing, or transformation."
"Give an example of a SOAP extensibility feature and its purpose.","WS-Security adds authentication and encryption to SOAP messages, ensuring secure communication. Other extensions include WS-Transactions and WS-Addressing."
"List three advantages of REST compared to SOAP.","1) Lower protocol overhead and simpler design. 2) Inherent caching support improves scalability. 3) Easier adoption without heavy libraries or tooling."
"List two scenarios where SOAP is still preferable over REST.","1) When strict service contracts are needed (via WSDL). 2) When WS-* extensions (e.g., transactions, advanced security) are required."
"Compare REST and RPC-based web services in terms of resource and operation focus.","RPC and SOAP focus on operations (many methods, few URIs), while REST focuses on resources (few methods, many URIs). REST transfers resource representations, whereas RPC transfers procedure names and parameters."

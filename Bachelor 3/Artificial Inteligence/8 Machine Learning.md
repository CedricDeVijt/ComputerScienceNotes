# Study Notes: Deep Learning

## Chapter 1: Introduction to Neural Networks

### Neural Networks and Perceptrons
- Neural Networks mimic the structure of the human brain, consisting of billions of neurons connected by synapses. These networks are capable of learning and adapting to tasks by adjusting their internal parameters.
- **Perceptron**: The foundational building block of neural networks, modeled as a simplified neuron. It serves as the basic unit for understanding how networks learn.
  - Accepts multiple weighted inputs and computes a single output based on an activation function, such as a step function or sigmoid.
  - Provides the basis for more complex architectures like multi-layer perceptrons and deep networks.
- Perceptrons are trained to classify data by iteratively adjusting weights to minimize errors, ensuring that the output matches expected results. This process is known as supervised learning.
- Perceptrons are limited to solving linearly separable problems, making them a stepping stone to more complex models.

## Chapter 2: Learning as Optimization

### Loss Functions and Gradient Descent
- Optimization in Neural Networks is the process of minimizing a loss function to improve the model's predictive accuracy. The loss function quantifies the error between predicted and actual values.
  - Common loss functions include:
    - **Quadratic Loss**: Penalizes squared differences between predictions and actual values, often used in regression tasks.
    - **Cross-Entropy Loss**: Measures the divergence between predicted probabilities and true class labels, widely used in classification tasks.
- **Gradient Descent** is an iterative algorithm for updating model weights to minimize the loss function. Key variants include:
  - **Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)**: Updates weights for each training sample, making it faster but noisier.
  - **Batch Gradient Descent**: Updates weights using the average gradient of the entire dataset, ensuring stability but requiring more computation.
  - **Mini-batch Gradient Descent**: Combines advantages of SGD and batch methods by using small batches of data.
- Advanced optimization techniques, such as momentum and adaptive learning rates, further enhance gradient descent's efficiency.

## Chapter 3: Multi-layer Perceptrons (MLPs)

### Structure and Backpropagation
- Multi-layer Perceptrons (MLPs) are neural networks with multiple layers, consisting of input, hidden, and output layers.
  - Hidden layers transform raw inputs into higher-level features, enabling the network to learn non-linear decision boundaries.
  - Activation functions like **sigmoid**, **tanh**, and **ReLU** introduce non-linearity, allowing the network to model complex patterns.
- **Backpropagation** is the core algorithm for training MLPs:
  - Forward propagation computes the outputs for a given input.
  - Backward propagation calculates gradients of the loss function with respect to weights using the chain rule.
  - Gradients are used to update weights, reducing the error in subsequent iterations.
- MLPs are universal function approximators, capable of representing any continuous function given sufficient neurons and layers.

## Chapter 4: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs)

### Features and Challenges
- Deep Neural Networks extend MLPs with many layers, forming deep architectures that capture hierarchical features from data.
  - Early layers extract low-level features (e.g., edges in images), while deeper layers capture high-level abstractions (e.g., objects in images).
- **Advantages**:
  - Automatic feature engineering eliminates the need for manual design of features.
  - Capable of modeling highly complex relationships between inputs and outputs.
- **Challenges**:
  - Require vast amounts of labeled data for effective training.
  - High computational demands necessitate specialized hardware like GPUs.
  - Prone to overfitting due to large capacity, mitigated by techniques like early stopping, regularization, and dropout.
- The **Universal Approximation Theorem** ensures that deep networks can approximate any function, making them highly versatile across domains.

## Chapter 5: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

### CNN Components and Applications
- CNNs are specifically designed for processing spatial data, such as images and videos.
  - **Convolutional Layers** apply kernels (small filters) to extract localized features like edges and textures.
  - **Pooling Layers** downsample feature maps, reducing dimensionality while retaining key information.
  - Fully connected layers map features to output predictions, such as class labels.
- **Advantages**:
  - Require fewer parameters compared to fully connected networks, reducing the risk of overfitting.
  - Capture spatial hierarchies, making them ideal for image and video processing.
- **Applications**:
  - Object recognition, facial detection, and medical imaging are just a few domains where CNNs excel.

### Examples of CNN Architectures
- **AlexNet (2012)**:
  - Introduced innovations like ReLU activations and dropout, winning the ImageNet competition.
- **ResNet (2015)**:
  - Solved the vanishing gradient problem with skip connections, enabling the training of very deep networks.

## Chapter 6: Advanced Topics in Deep Learning

### Hyperparameters and Regularization
- **Hyperparameters** include:
  - Learning rate: Controls the step size in gradient descent.
  - Network architecture: Determines the number and size of layers.
  - Activation and loss functions: Impact how networks process and evaluate data.
- **Regularization Techniques**:
  - L1 and L2 regularization add penalties to the loss function to discourage overfitting.
  - **Dropout** randomly disables neurons during training, improving generalization.
  - **Data Augmentation** increases training data diversity through transformations like rotation, scaling, and flipping.

### Pre-training and Transfer Learning
- **Pre-training** uses models trained on large datasets to initialize weights for related tasks, reducing the need for extensive labeled data.
  - Examples include fine-tuning ImageNet-trained models for specialized tasks like medical image analysis.
- Transfer learning has become a cornerstone in leveraging existing knowledge for efficient training in resource-constrained scenarios.

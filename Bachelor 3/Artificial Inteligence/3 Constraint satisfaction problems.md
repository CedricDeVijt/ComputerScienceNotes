## 3.1: Introduction to CSPs
### Definition
- **CSP**: A type of search problem where the state is defined by **variables** and their **domains**. The goal is to find assignments of values to variables that satisfy all **constraints**.

### CSP Characteristics:
- **Variables**: Represent the entities we are trying to assign values to.
- **Domains**: Possible values that the variables can take.
- **Constraints**: Rules that limit the combinations of variable assignments.

### Key Examples:
1. **Map Coloring**: Variables are regions, domains are colors, and constraints are that adjacent regions must have different colors.
2. **N-Queens Problem**: Assign queens to positions on a chessboard such that no two queens attack each other.
3. **Cryptarithmetic**: Assign digits to letters to satisfy arithmetic operations.
4. **Sudoku**: Fill the grid with numbers so that rows, columns, and regions have unique values.

## 3.2: Solving CSPs
### Standard Search Formulation
- **States**: Partial assignments of variables.
- **Initial State**: Empty assignment.
- **Successor Function**: Assign a value to an unassigned variable.
- **Goal Test**: Complete assignment satisfies all constraints.

### Backtracking Search
- A **depth-first search** (DFS) approach where:
  1. Variables are assigned values one by one.
  2. Constraints are checked incrementally to avoid invalid assignments.

#### Backtracking Improvements:
1. **Variable Ordering**: Prioritize the most constrained variables (Minimum Remaining Values, MRV).
2. **Value Ordering**: Choose the least constraining value to minimize future conflicts.
3. **Constraint Propagation**: Methods like **Forward Checking** and **Arc Consistency** prune domains early to avoid future conflicts.

## 3.3: Filtering Techniques
### Filtering:
- **Forward Checking**: Eliminates values from variable domains that violate constraints with already assigned variables.
  
### Arc Consistency
- A variable pair (X → Y) is **arc consistent** if, for every value of X, there is a corresponding value of Y that satisfies the constraint.
- **AC-3 Algorithm**: Ensures that all variable pairs are arc consistent by systematically checking and removing inconsistent values.

### Limitations:
- Even with arc consistency, CSPs might still have multiple solutions or no solution at all, so further search is necessary.

## 3.4: Advanced Search Techniques
### Improving Search Efficiency
- **Ordering**: Use heuristic approaches like MRV and **Least Constraining Value** (LCV) to prioritize search.
  
### Tree-Structured CSPs
- CSPs with a **tree structure** can be solved in **linear time** (O(n d²)) by:
  1. Ensuring arc consistency in a backward pass.
  2. Assigning values in a forward pass without backtracking.

### Cutset Conditioning
- When a CSP is not tree-structured, it can be converted by selecting a **cutset** (a set of variables that, when instantiated, turns the remaining graph into a tree).

## 3.5: Local Search Methods
### Iterative Improvement
- **Min-Conflicts Heuristic**: Works by continuously reassigning values to variables to minimize the number of conflicts (unsatisfied constraints).
  
### Performance:
- Efficient for problems like the **n-queens** problem, where it can solve large instances with millions of variables in nearly constant time.

## Key Points to Remember:

- **Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs)** involve assigning values to variables such that a set of constraints is satisfied.
- **Backtracking Search** is the basic uninformed method but can be optimized using:
  - **Forward Checking**: Prune future values that will lead to conflicts.
  - **Arc Consistency (AC-3)**: Ensures no variable pair has unsatisfiable constraints.
  - **MRV & LCV**: Heuristics for choosing variables and values to reduce search space.
- **Tree-structured CSPs** can be solved efficiently, and **cutset conditioning** can turn cyclic graphs into tree-structured CSPs.
- **Iterative local search (min-conflicts)** is a powerful method for large CSPs like the **n-queens problem**.

## Study Highlights:

- **CSPs** are more structured than general search problems, allowing specialized algorithms.
- **Backtracking** with optimizations like **ordering** and **filtering** significantly speeds up the solution process.
- **Arc Consistency** (AC-3) is a crucial technique in pruning domains and ensuring efficient CSP resolution.
- **Tree-structured CSPs** offer a clear path to fast solutions, but most real-world problems require more complex approaches like **cutset conditioning**.
- **Local Search** with the **min-conflicts** heuristic is a practical method for solving large-scale CSPs.

## 1.1 Agents
- **Agent**: anything that can be viewed as perceiving its environment through sensors and acting upon that environment through actuators.

### 1.1.1 Agent types
- **Reflex agent**: selects actions based on the current percept, ignoring the rest of the percept history.
- **Model-based reflex agent**: maintains an internal state that depends on the percept history and thereby can select different actions in the same situation.

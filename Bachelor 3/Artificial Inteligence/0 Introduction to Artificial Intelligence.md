### Key Milestones in AI History

- _1950: Turing Test_: A test proposed by Alan Turing to determine if a machine can exhibit intelligent behavior equivalent to, or indistinguishable from, a human.
- _1956: Perceptron_: The first algorithm for supervised learning of binary classifiers, marking the birth of neural networks.
- _1960: ELIZA_: An early natural language processing program that simulates conversation.
- _1970s: AI Winter_: A period of reduced funding and interest in AI due to unmet expectations.
- _1980s: Expert Systems_: AI systems that apply reasoning to knowledge to provide expert-level solutions. Example: IF an infection condition is met, THEN provide a diagnosis with a certain probability.
- _1990s: Machine Learning_: The emergence of supervised and reinforcement learning techniques.
  - _Supervised learning_: Learning from labeled data.
  - _Reinforcement learning_: Learning based on rewards from actions in an environment.
- _1997: Deep Blue_: The first AI to defeat a world chess champion, Garry Kasparov.
- _2011: Watson_: IBM's AI system that defeated human champions in Jeopardy!
- _2016: AlphaGo_: AI by DeepMind that defeated a world Go champion, Lee Sedol.

### Recent AI Developments

- _2020s: Generative AI_: AI capable of generating text, images, and other media through large language models.
- _Reinforcement learning with human feedback_: An advancement where AI improves by receiving feedback from humans during the learning process.
- _Multi-modal AI_: AI that can process and generate multiple types of data, such as text, images, and sound.

# 1 Agents that Plan Ahead
## 1.1 Reflex Agents
Choose action based on current percept (and maybe memory)
May have memory or a model of the world’s current state
Do not consider the future consequences of their actions
Consider how the world IS

## 1.2 Planning Agents
Ask “what if”
Decisions based on (hypothesized) consequences of actions
Must have a model of how the world evolves in response to actions
Must formulate a goal (test)
Consider how the world WOULD BE

# 2 Search Problems
Search problem consists of:
- state space
- successor function
- start state
- goal test

A solution is a sequence of actions (a plan) which transforms the start state to a goal state

State space graph: A mathematical
representation of a search problem
- Nodes are (abstracted) world configurations
- Arcs represent successors (action results)
- The goal test is a set of goal nodes (maybe only one)

In a state space graph, each state occurs only
once

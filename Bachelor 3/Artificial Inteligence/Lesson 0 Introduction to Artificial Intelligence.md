### Key Milestones in AI History
- *1950: Turing Test*: A test proposed by Alan Turing to determine if a machine can exhibit intelligent behavior equivalent to, or indistinguishable from, a human.
- *1956: Perceptron*: The first algorithm for supervised learning of binary classifiers, marking the birth of neural networks.
- *1960: ELIZA*: An early natural language processing program that simulates conversation.
- *1970s: AI Winter*: A period of reduced funding and interest in AI due to unmet expectations.
- *1980s: Expert Systems*: AI systems that apply reasoning to knowledge to provide expert-level solutions. Example: IF an infection condition is met, THEN provide a diagnosis with a certain probability.
- *1990s: Machine Learning*: The emergence of supervised and reinforcement learning techniques.
  - *Supervised learning*: Learning from labeled data.
  - *Reinforcement learning*: Learning based on rewards from actions in an environment.
- *1997: Deep Blue*: The first AI to defeat a world chess champion, Garry Kasparov.
- *2011: Watson*: IBM's AI system that defeated human champions in Jeopardy!
- *2016: AlphaGo*: AI by DeepMind that defeated a world Go champion, Lee Sedol.

### Recent AI Developments
- *2020s: Generative AI*: AI capable of generating text, images, and other media through large language models.
- *Reinforcement learning with human feedback*: An advancement where AI improves by receiving feedback from humans during the learning process.

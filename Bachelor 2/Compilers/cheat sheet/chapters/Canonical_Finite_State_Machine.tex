\subsection{Canonical Finite State Machine}
A canonical finite state machine is a deterministic finite automaton (DFA) that is in a standard form. The canonical form is obtained by removing unreachable states and minimizing the number of states. The canonical form is unique for a given language. The canonical form is useful for comparing two DFAs to determine if they recognize the same language.

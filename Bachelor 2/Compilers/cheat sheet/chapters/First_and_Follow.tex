\subsection{Calculate First and Follow}
\subsubsection{First $^k(\alpha)$}
1. Initialization:
   For every terminal $a$, set $First^k(a) = {a}$ (since a terminal generates only itself).
   Initialize $First^k(A)$ to an empty set for every variable $A$.

2. Iterative Update:
   Repeat until no changes occur:
     For each variable $A$ with a production rule $A → X_1 X_2 ... X_n$:
     Compute $First^k(X_1)$, $First^k(X_2)$, ..., $First^k(X_n)$.
     Concatenate elements from $First^k(X_1)$, $First^k(X_2)$, ..., $First^k(X_n)$ and truncate the results to length $k$.
       Update $First^k(A)$ with these truncated elements if they are not already present.

3. Completion:
   The process stops when no $First^k$ sets are updated in an iteration, meaning all sets have stabilized.

\subsubsection{Follow $^k(\alpha)$}
1. Initialization:
   Initialize $Follow^k(X)$ to an empty set for each variable $X$.

2. Iterative Update:
   Repeat until no changes occur:
     For each rule $A → αBβ$:
       Compute $First^k(β)$ (where β is the part of the right-hand side following $B$).
       Add $First^k(β)$ elements to $Follow^k(B)$, completing them with $Follow^k(A)$ if needed to ensure they reach length $k$.
       Update $Follow^k(B)$ with these completed elements if they are not already present.

3. Completion:
   The process stops when no $Follow^k$ sets are updated in an iteration, meaning all sets have stabilized.

\subsection{First and Follow}
\subsubsection{First}
The $FIRST$ set of a non-terminal symbol A in a grammar is the set of terminal symbols that appear at the beginning of any string derived from A.

\textbf{How to Compute:}
For a non-terminal symbol A:
    If A can derive a string that starts with a terminal symbol, include that terminal in $FIRST(A)$.
    If A can derive $\epsilon$ (the empty string), include $\epsilon$ in $FIRST(A)$.
    For a production $A \rightarrow B_1 B_2 \ldots B_n$ :
    Include the $FIRST$ set of $B_1$ in $FIRST(A)$.
    If $B_1$ can derive $\epsilon$, then include $FIRST(B_2)$ in $FIRST(A)$, and so on for subsequent $B_i$ until a non-$\epsilon$ deriving symbol is found or all $B_i$ derive $\epsilon$.

\subsubsection{Follow}
The FOLLOW set of a non-terminal symbol A is the set of terminal symbols that can appear immediately to the right of A in some sentential form derived from the start symbol of the grammar.


\textbf{How to Compute:}
1. Initialization:
   Add \$ (the end-of-input marker) to FOLLOW set of the start symbol.
2. For Each Production $A \rightarrow \alpha B \beta$:
   Add $FIRST(\beta$) (excluding $\epsilon$) to $FOLLOW(B)$.
   If $\beta$ can derive $\epsilon$ (or if $\beta$ is empty), add $FOLLOW(A)$ to $FOLLOW(B)$.
3. Repeat Until No Changes:
   Continue updating the FOLLOW sets until no more symbols can be added.


\subsubsection{ItemFollows}
The $FIRST$ set of a string of symbols is the set of terminals that can appear as the first symbol of a string derived from the given string.

The $FOLLOW$ set of a string of symbols is the set of terminals that can appear immediately to the right of the string in some sentential form derived from the start symbol of the grammar.

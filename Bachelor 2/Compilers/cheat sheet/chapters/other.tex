\textbf{Rewriting Grammars for Precedence}
Identify Operators: E.g., + (addition), * (multiplication).
Assign Precedence:
Higher precedence (e.g., *) gets lower-level nonterminals.
Lower precedence (e.g., +) gets higher-level nonterminals.
Rewrite CFG:
For multiplication before addition: Exp → Exp + Term | Term, Term → Term * Factor | Factor.
Add parentheses: Factor → (Exp) | cst.
Verify: Ensure parse trees respect operator precedence.

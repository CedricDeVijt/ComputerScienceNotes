\section{Grammars}

\subsection{LL(k) Grammar}
A CFG is LL(k) if:
The grammar can be parsed by a top-down parser with $k$ lookahead tokens.
The parsing table has no ambiguity and is deterministic.

\subsection{SLR(k) Grammar}
A CFG is SLR(k) if:
It is LR(k) (i.e., it can be parsed by an LR(k) parser).
The parsing table has no shift/reduce or reduce/reduce conflicts when using the FOLLOW sets to resolve conflicts.


\subsection{LALR(k) Grammar}
A CFG is LALR(k) if:
It is LR(k).
The parsing table can be constructed using LALR(k) lookahead by merging states with the same core (LALR(k) states).

LALR(k) is a refinement of SLR(k) that reduces the number of states while maintaining LR(k) power.

\subsection{LR(k) Grammar}
A CFG is LR(k) if:
It has no shift/reduce or reduce/reduce conflicts for a given k.
The grammar can be parsed by an LR(k) parser using the complete parsing table.

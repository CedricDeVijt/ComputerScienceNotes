\section{Key Definitions and Concepts}
\textbf{Regular language}: languages that can be recognized by finite automata or described by regular expressions

\textbf{CFG}: formal grammar where every production rule has a single non-terminal symbol on the left-hand side and a string of terminals and\/or non-terminals on the right-hand side.

\textbf{CFL}: if it can be generated by a context-free grammar (CFG)

\textbf{LL(k) language}: if there is an LL(k) grammar G_L that accepts it, i.e.: L(G_L )= L.

\textbf{Maximal munch}: the longest possible string that can be matched by a token is matched.


\textbf{Strongly LL(k) Grammar}: A $CFG G = \langle V ,T ,P,S \rangle $ is strong LL(k) iff, for all pairs of rules $A \rightarrow \alpha_1$ and $A \rightarrow \alpha_2$ in $P$. (with $\alpha_1 \neq \alpha_2$$): 

$First^k (\alpha_1 \cdot Follow^k (A)) \cap First^k (\alpha_2 \cdot Follow^k (A)) = \emptyset$

\section{Key Definitions and Concepts}
\textbf{Regular language}: languages that can be recognized by finite automata or described by regular expressions

\textbf{CFG}: formal grammar where every production rule has a single non-terminal symbol on the left-hand side and a string of terminals and\/or non-terminals on the right-hand side.

\textbf{CFL}: if it can be generated by a context-free grammar (CFG)

\textbf{LL(k) language}: if there is an LL(k) grammar G_L that accepts it, i.e.: L(G_L )= L.

\textbf{Maximal munch}: the longest possible string that can be matched by a token is matched.

\subsection{Undecidability of Type Checking and Reachability Analysis}
The exact versions of both type checking and reachability analysis are undecidable because they would require solving the halting problem, which is proven to be undecidable. For type checking, determining the exact type of an expression in all possible cases would involve analyzing all potential program executions, which is equivalent to solving whether a program halts with certain inputs. Similarly, exact reachability analysis involves determining whether a specific program state can be reached, which also boils down to predicting the behavior of all possible executions, again leading to the halting problem. Since the halting problem is undecidable, both exact type checking and exact reachability analysis are also undecidable.

## Consider the language of (integer) arithmetic expressions defined by the following grammar.
(1) S → Exp
(2) Exp → Exp ∗Exp
(3) Exp → Exp + Exp
(4) Exp → cst

(a) Rewrite the grammar so that all parse trees respect the order of operations (i.e.
multiplication before addition).
(b) Is the language LL(1)?

## Consider once more the language of arithmetic expressions and add to it parentheses (with the usual interpretation that they have higher precedence than all other operations).
(a) Give the grammar for the new language, again so that all parse trees respect the
order of operations.
(b) Is the language LL(1)?

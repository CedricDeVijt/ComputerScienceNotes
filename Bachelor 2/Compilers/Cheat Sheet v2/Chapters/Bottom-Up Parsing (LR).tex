% 5. Bottom-Up Parsing (LR Family)
% Purpose: Shift-reduce parsing methods

% LR(k): Canonical LR parsing with full item sets
% SLR(k): Simplified LR using Follow sets
% LALR(k): Lookahead LR with merged states
% Parser Hierarchy: Relationships between LL, SLR, LALR, LR
% Canonical FSM Construction: Step-by-step CFSM building

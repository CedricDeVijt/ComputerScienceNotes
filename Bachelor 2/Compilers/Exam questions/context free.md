## Argue that the following language over the alphabet Σ = {0, 1} is context free:

$$L_{pal}= {ww^R |w \in \Sigma^∗}$$
where $w^R$ denotes the word spelled in reverse order.

## Argue that the following language over the alphabet Σ = {0,1,#} is context free:

$$L_{pal\#}= \{w\#w^R |w\in \Sigma^*\}$$
where $w^R^ denotes the word spelled in reverse order.

## Argue that Lpal, from the previous question, cannot be recognized by a deterministic pushdown automaton.

## Write regular expressions for lexical units string, for number, and for all three constants for JSON documents.

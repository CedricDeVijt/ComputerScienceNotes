## 1. Key Definitions and Concepts

### 1.1 Formal Languages
- **Alphabet (Σ)**: A finite set of symbols (e.g., Σ = {0, 1} or {a, b, c}).
- **String**: A finite sequence of symbols from Σ. The empty string is denoted ε.
- **Language**: A set of strings over Σ. Can be regular, context-free, context-sensitive, or recursively enumerable.
- **Regular Language**: A language recognized by a finite automaton (DFA or NFA) or described by a regular expression.
- **Context-Free Language (CFL)**: A language generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) or recognized by a pushdown automaton (PDA).
- **Context-Sensitive Language**: A language generated by a context-sensitive grammar.
- **$w^R$**: The reverse of a string w (e.g., if w = "abc", then w^R = "cba").

### 1.2 Automata
- **Finite Automaton (FA)**:
  - **Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA)**: A 5-tuple (Q, Σ, δ, q0, F), where Q is a set of states, Σ is the alphabet, δ is the transition function (δ: Q × Σ → Q), q0 is the start state, and F is the set of accept states. Exactly one transition per input symbol.
  - **Nondeterministic Finite Automaton (NFA)**: Similar to DFA, but δ: Q × (Σ ∪ {ε}) → 2^Q (multiple or ε-transitions possible). NFAs can be converted to DFAs via subset construction.
- **Pushdown Automaton (PDA)**:
  - A 6-tuple (Q, Σ, Γ, δ, q0, F), where Γ is the stack alphabet, and δ: Q × (Σ ∪ {ε}) × (Γ ∪ {ε}) → 2^(Q × Γ*). Uses a stack for memory.
  - **Deterministic PDA (DPDA)**: At most one transition for each state, input, and stack symbol. Recognizes a subset of CFLs.
  - **Nondeterministic PDA (NPDA)**: Can have multiple transitions. Recognizes all CFLs.
- **Canonical Finite-State Machine**: A DFA derived from a grammar or language description, often minimal (fewest states).

### 1.3 Grammars
- **Chomsky Hierarchy**:
  - **Type-0 (Recursively Enumerable)**: Unrestricted grammars.
  - **Type-1 (Context-Sensitive)**: Rules of the form αAβ → αγβ (context around A).
  - **Type-2 (Context-Free)**: Rules of the form A → α, where A is a nonterminal, and α is a string of terminals and nonterminals.
  - **Type-3 (Regular)**: Rules of the form A → aB or A → a (right-linear) or A → Ba or A → a (left-linear).
- **Context-Free Grammar (CFG)**: A 4-tuple (V, T, P, S), where V is a set of nonterminals, T is a set of terminals, P is a set of production rules, and S is the start symbol.
- **Ambiguity**: A CFG is ambiguous if a string has multiple parse trees. Ambiguity can affect parsing.
- **Leftmost/Rightmost Derivation**: Derivations where the leftmost/rightmost nonterminal is replaced at each step. Used in LL/LR parsing.

### 1.4 Parsing
- **LL(k) Parsing**: Top-down parsing with k-token lookahead. Uses leftmost derivations.
  - **LL(1)**: One token lookahead. Requires no conflicts in the parsing table (FIRST/FOLLOW sets).
  - **Strong LL(k)**: Parsing decisions depend only on the first k tokens of the remaining input, not on prior context.
- **LR(k) Parsing**: Bottom-up parsing with k-token lookahead. Uses rightmost derivations in reverse.
  - **LR(0)**: No lookahead. Uses closure and goto functions to build states.
  - **SLR(1)**: Simple LR with FOLLOW sets for reductions.
  - **LALR(1)**: Lookahead LR, merges LR(1) states with same core items but different lookaheads.
  - **LR(1)**: Full LR with precise lookaheads for each item.
- **Item**: A production with a dot (•) indicating parsing progress (e.g., A → α•β).
- **Closure of Items**: For a set of items, include all items derivable by expanding nonterminals after the dot.
- **FIRST_k(A)**: Set of all terminal strings of length ≤ k derivable from A.
- **FOLLOW_k(A)**: Set of all terminal strings of length ≤ k that can appear after A in a derivation.

### 1.5 Regular Expressions
- **Regular Expression (RE)**: A pattern describing a regular language. Operators: concatenation, union (|), Kleene star (*).
- **Lexical Units**: Tokens like identifiers, numbers, or constants in a language (e.g., JSON strings, numbers, true/false/null).
- **Longest Match Principle**: In lexical analysis, the scanner chooses the longest prefix of the input that matches a token.

## 2. Methodologies for Common Question Types

### 2.1 Constructing a Canonical Finite-State Machine for a Grammar
1. **Understand the Grammar**: Identify terminals (T) and nonterminals. Ensure the grammar is context-free or regular.
2. **Convert to DFA**:
   - Treat each production as a path in an NFA.
   - States represent nonterminals or positions in productions.
   - Transitions are labeled with terminals.
   - Add a final state for the end marker (e.g., $).
3. **Minimize the DFA**:
   - Use subset construction to convert NFA to DFA.
   - Merge equivalent states using the minimization algorithm (partition refinement).
4. **Verify**: Ensure the DFA accepts all strings generated by the grammar.

**Example**: For a grammar S → aA, A → b, the NFA has states for S, A, and a final state, with transitions S → a → A → b → F. Convert to DFA and minimize.

### 2.2 Proving a Language is Context-Free
1. **Construct a CFG**:
   - Define nonterminals and productions that generate the language.
   - For palindromes (e.g., L_pal = {ww^R}), use rules like S → 0S0 | 1S1 | ε.
2. **Construct an NPDA** (alternative):
   - Push w onto the stack, then match w^R by popping.
   - States track pushing, turning, and popping phases.
3. **Argue Correctness**:
   - Show the CFG/NPDA generates/accepts exactly the language.
   - For L_pal#, the # separator simplifies the NPDA by marking the turn point.

**Why Not Regular?**: Use the pumping lemma for regular languages to show L_pal is not regular (pumping breaks palindrome property).

### 2.3 Proving a Language Cannot Be Recognized by a DPDA
1. **Show the Language is CFL**: Construct a CFG or NPDA.
2. **Argue Nondeterminism is Necessary**:
   - Demonstrate that a DPDA cannot handle the language due to ambiguity or unbounded lookahead.
   - For L_pal, a DPDA cannot deterministically decide the middle of ww^R without guessing.
3. **Use Closure Properties**: CFLs recognized by DPDAs are closed under complement, but L_pal’s complement may require nondeterminism.

### 2.4 Writing Regular Expressions for Lexical Units
1. **Identify Token Types**:
   - **Identifiers**: Typically start with a letter, followed by letters/digits (e.g., [a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9]*).
   - **Numbers**: Integers or floats (e.g., -?[0-9]+(\.[0-9]+)?).
   - **Constants**: Fixed strings (e.g., for JSON: "true", "false", "null").
2. **Write REs**:
   - Use standard RE syntax: concatenation, |, *, +, ?, [].
   - For JSON strings: \"([^\"\\]|\\.)*\" (handles escaped characters).
3. **Test REs**: Ensure they match all valid tokens and exclude invalid ones.

### 2.5 Constructing Minimal DFAs for Regular Expressions
1. **Convert RE to NFA**:
   - Use Thompson’s construction: build NFA fragments for each operator.
2. **Convert NFA to DFA**:
   - Use subset construction: states are sets of NFA states.
3. **Minimize DFA**:
   - Apply partition refinement: merge states with identical behavior.
4. **Draw DFA**: Label states, transitions, start, and accept states.

### 2.6 Computing FIRST_k and FOLLOW_k Sets
1. **FIRST_k(A)**:
   - If A → ε, include ε.
   - For A → X1X2…, take the first k symbols of FIRST_k(X1) ∪ FIRST_k(X2) if X1 derives ε, etc.
   - Iterate until no changes.
2. **FOLLOW_k(A)**:
   - For S (start), include $ (end marker).
   - For A → αBβ, include FIRST_k(β).
   - If β derives ε, include FOLLOW_k(A).
   - Iterate until no changes.

### 2.7 Computing Closure of LR Items
1. **Start with Given Items**: E.g., {E → B + •U}.
2. **Apply Closure Rule**:
   - For each item A → α•Bβ, add B → •γ for all productions of B.
   - Repeat until no new items are added.
3. **Example**: For {E → B + •U}, add U → •X (from U → X) and X → •ε (from X → ε).

### 2.8 Rewriting Grammars for Precedence
1. **Identify Operators**: E.g., + (addition), * (multiplication).
2. **Assign Precedence**:
   - Higher precedence (e.g., *) gets lower-level nonterminals.
   - Lower precedence (e.g., +) gets higher-level nonterminals.
3. **Rewrite CFG**:
   - For multiplication before addition: Exp → Exp + Term | Term, Term → Term * Factor | Factor.
   - Add parentheses: Factor → (Exp) | cst.
4. **Verify**: Ensure parse trees respect operator precedence.

### 2.9 Checking if a Grammar is LL(1), LR(1), SLR(1), LALR(1), etc.
1. **LL(1)**:
   - Compute FIRST and FOLLOW sets.
   - Build the parsing table: for A → α, enter α in table[A, t] where t ∈ FIRST(α). If α derives ε, use FOLLOW(A).
   - No conflicts (multiple entries) → LL(1).
2. **LR(0)**:
   - Build LR(0) items and state transitions.
   - No shift-reduce or reduce-reduce conflicts → LR(0).
3. **SLR(1)**:
   - Like LR(0), but reductions use FOLLOW sets.
   - No conflicts with FOLLOW-based reductions → SLR(1).
4. **LALR(1)**:
   - Build LR(1) items, merge states with same core.
   - No conflicts after merging → LALR(1).
5. **LR(1)**:
   - Full LR(1) items with lookaheads.
   - No conflicts → LR(1).

### 2.10 Checking if a Language is Regular
1. **Construct a DFA/NFA**: If possible, the language is regular.
2. **Use Pumping Lemma**:
   - Assume the language is regular.
   - Choose a string longer than the pumping length p.
   - Show that pumping breaks the language property (e.g., JSON’s nested structures).
3. **Closure Properties**: Regular languages are closed under union, concatenation, star, complement, intersection. Non-regular languages (e.g., JSON, Python dictionaries) require unbounded nesting.

### 2.11 Longest Match Principle in Lexical Analysis
1. **Simulate the DFA**:
   - Run the DFA on the input string.
   - Track the longest prefix that reaches an accept state.
2. **Output Token**: The longest matching prefix corresponds to the token.
3. **Example**: For input "abbbbc" and a DFA for a*b*, the longest match is "abbbb" if the DFA accepts a*b*.

## 3. Step-by-Step Problem-Solving Checklist
1. **Read Carefully**: Identify the type of question (grammar, automaton, parsing, regular expression).
2. **Define Terms**: Recall definitions (e.g., CFG, DFA, LL(1)).
3. **Choose a Method**:
   - Grammar → Derive strings, check ambiguity, compute FIRST/FOLLOW.
   - Automaton → Construct NFA/DFA, minimize, or simulate.
   - Parsing → Build parsing tables or LR items.
   - Regular Expression → Write RE, convert to DFA.
4. **Apply Method**: Follow the steps outlined above.
5. **Verify**: Check if the solution matches the language or grammar requirements.
6. **Handle Edge Cases**: Consider ε, empty language, or conflicts.

## 4. Common Pitfalls and Tips
- **Ambiguity**: Always check if a grammar has multiple parse trees for a string.
- **Conflicts**: In parsing, conflicts indicate a grammar is not LL(k)/LR(k).
- **Minimization**: Don’t skip DFA minimization unless asked.
- **Lookahead**: For LL/LR, ensure lookaheads are computed correctly.
- **Nonterminals vs. Terminals**: Clearly distinguish in grammars and automata.
- **Pumping Lemma**: Use it to prove non-regularity or non-CFL status, but carefully select the string.

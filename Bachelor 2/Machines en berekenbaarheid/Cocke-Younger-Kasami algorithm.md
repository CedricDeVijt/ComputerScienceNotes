## 1. Initialize the Table
- Create a table `P` with dimensions `n x n`, where `P[i][j]` will store the set of variables (non-terminals) that generate the substring `w[i..j]`.

## 2. Fill the Table for Single Characters
- For each `i` from `1` to `n`, and for each production `A → a` in `G`:
  - If `w[i] = a`, add `A` to `P[i][i]`.

## 3. Fill the Table for Longer Substrings
- For each substring length `l` from `2` to `n`:
  - For each starting position `i` from `1` to `n-l+1`:
    - Let `j = i + l - 1`, which marks the endpoint of the substring.
    - For each position `k` from `i` to `j-1`:
      - For each production `A → BC` in `G`, check if `B ∈ P[i][k]` and `C ∈ P[k+1][j]`.
      - If both conditions are true, add `A` to `P[i][j]`.

## 4. Check the Start Symbol
- After filling the table, check if the start symbol `S` is in `P[1][n]`:
  - If `S ∈ P[1][n]`, then `w` is in the language generated by `G`.
  - Otherwise, `w` is not in the language.

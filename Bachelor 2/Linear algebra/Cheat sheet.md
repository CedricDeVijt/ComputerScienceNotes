Triangular inequality:
$\|a+b\| ≤ \|a\|+\|b\|$
Cauchy-Schwartz inequality:
$\langle x,y \rangle ≤ \|a\| \|b\|$
Inner product
$\langle x,y \rangle = a_1b_1 + a_2b_2 +. . . + a_nb_n = \|a\|\|b\|\cos \theta$

**Column space**: For a given matrix $A \in \mathbb{R}^{m\times n}$, the set of all linear combinations of columns of A forms the column space which is denoted by C(A).
**Nullspace**: For a given matrix $A \in \mathbb{R}^{m\times n}$, the set of all solutions of the homogeneous linear system Ax = 0 is called nullspace of A, which is denoted by N (A)

**Rank** of a matrix $A \in \mathbb{R}^{m\times n}$ : maximum number of linearly independent column vectors (or row vectors) in the matrix.

**Row space**: The subspace spanned by the rows of $A$. The row space of $A$ is column space of $A^T$

**Left nullspace**: the set of all solutions of the homogeneous linear system $A^T x = 0$

## Ch5 Inverse Matrices
For $A \in \mathbb{R}^{n\times n}:  AA^{-1}=I^n$

Solving linear system of equations using inverse matrices
$x = A^{-1}b$

Cramer’s Rule:
Let $Ax= b$ for $B \in \mathbb{R}^{n}$ and $A \in \mathbb{R}^{m\times n}$ with $det(A) ≠ 0$. Then, this system is solved by determinants, i.e.
$x_i=\frac{det(B_i)}{det(A)}$ for $i = 1,2,...,n$
where the matrix Bi has the ith column of A replaced by b, i.e.,

## PROOF IDEA

Showing that SAT is in NP is easy, and we do so shortly. The hard part of the proof is showing that any language in NP is polynomial time reducible to SAT.
To do so, we construct a polynomial time reduction for each language A in NP to SAT. The reduction for A takes a string w and produces a Boolean formula $φ$ that simulates the NP machine for A on input w. If the machine accepts, $φ$ has a satisfying assignment that corresponds to the accepting computation. If the machine doesn’t accept, no assignment satisfies $φ$. Therefore, w is in A if and only if $φ$ is satisfiable.
Actually constructing the reduction to work in this way is a conceptually simple task, though we must cope with many details. A Boolean formula may contain the Boolean operations AND, OR, and NOT, and these operations form the basis for the circuitry used in electronic computers. Hence the fact that we can design a Boolean formula to simulate a Turing machine isn’t surprising. The details are in the implementation of this idea.

## PROOF

First, we show that SAT is in NP. A nondeterministic polynomial time machine can guess an assignment to a given formula φ and accept if the assignment satisfies $φ$.

Next, we take any language A in NP and show that A is polynomial time reducible to SAT. Let N be a nondeterministic Turing machine that decides A in $n^k$ time for some constant k. (For convenience, we actually assume that N runs in time $n^k-3$.) The following notion helps to describe the reduction.

A tableau for N on w is an $n^k \times n^k$ table whose rows are the configurations of a branch of the computation of N on input w, as shown in the following figure.

## PROOF IDEA:

The subset is the certificate.

## PROOF:

The following is a verifier V for SUBSET-SUM.

V = “On input $⟨⟨S,t⟩,c⟩$:

1. Test whether cis a collection of numbers that sum to t.
2. Test whether Scontains all the numbers in c.
3. If both pass, accept; otherwise, reject.
   ”

## ALTERNATIVE PROOF

We can also prove this theorem by giving a nondeterministic polynomial time Turing machine for SUBSET-SUM as follows.

N = “On input $⟨S,t⟩$:

1. Nondeterministically select a subset cof the numbers in S.
2. Test whether cis a collection of numbers that sum to t.
3. If the test passes, accept; otherwise, reject.
   ”

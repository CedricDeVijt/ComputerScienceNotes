## PROOF IDEA:

The subset is the certificate.

## PROOF:

The following is a verifier $V$ for SUBSET-SUM.

$V$ = “On input $⟨⟨S,t⟩,c⟩$:

1. Test whether $c$ is a collection of numbers that sum to $t$.
2. Test whether $S$ contains all the numbers in $c$.
3. If both pass, accept; otherwise, reject.”

A language is in NP iff it is decided by some nondeterministic polynomial time Turing machine.

## PROOF IDEA:

We show how to convert a polynomial time verifier to an equivalent polynomial time NTM and vice versa. The NTM simulates the verifier by guessing the certificate. The verifier simulates the NTM by using the accepting branch as the certificate.

## PROOF:

For the forward direction of this theorem, let $A \in NP$ and show that $A$ is decided by a polynomial time NTM N. Let $V$ be the polynomial time verifier for $A$ that exists by the definition of NP. Assume that V is a TM that runs in time $nk$ and construct N as follows.

N= “On input w of length n:

1. Nondeterministically select string cof length at most $n^k$.
2. Run V on input $⟨w,c⟩$.
3. If V accepts, accept; otherwise, reject.

”

To prove the other direction of the theorem, assume that A is decided by a polynomial time NTM N and construct a polynomial time verifier V as follows.

V=
“On input $⟨w,c⟩$, where w and c are strings:

1. Simulate N on input w, treating each symbol of cas a description of the nondeterministic choice to make at each step.
2. If this branch of N’s computation accepts, accept; otherwise, reject.

If $A \leq_L B$ and $B \in L$, then $A \in L$

## PROOF

A naive approach would be to first compute the entire string $f(w)$ using the log space reduction $f$, and then apply the log space algorithm for $B$ to this result. However, the storage required for $f(w)$ may be too large to fit within the log space bound, so we need a more sophisticated approach.

Instead, we construct a log space algorithm $M_A$ for $A$ that computes individual symbols of $f(w)$ on demand as needed by $B$'s machine $M_B$. The key insight is that we can simulate $M_B$ running on input $f(w)$ without ever storing the entire string $f(w)$.

The algorithm $M_A$ works as follows: it simulates $M_B$ and keeps track of where $M_B$'s input head would be positioned on $f(w)$. Whenever $M_B$ needs to read a symbol at a particular position in $f(w)$, $M_A$ computes that specific symbol by rerunning the log space reduction $f$ on input $w$ from the beginning and outputting only the symbol at the desired position.

This approach requires recomputing parts of $f(w)$ multiple times, making it inefficient in time complexity. However, the crucial advantage is that only a single symbol of $f(w)$ needs to be stored at any point, allowing us to stay within the log space bound by trading time for space.

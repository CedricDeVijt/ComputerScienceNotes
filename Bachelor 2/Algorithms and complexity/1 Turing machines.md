## 1.1 Introduction to Turing Machines

### Definition and Purpose

A **Turing Machine (TM)** is a mathematical model of computation that can simulate any algorithm. It consists of an infinite tape, a read/write head, and a finite set of states with transition rules. Why is this model significant? It provides a framework to explore what is computable and what is not, forming the foundation of theoretical computer science.

### Importance in Computer Science

TMs are central to understanding **computability** and **complexity**. They help define which problems can be solved algorithmically and how efficiently. For instance, TMs are used to study languages and decision problems, influencing fields like algorithm design and artificial intelligence.

### Comparison with Other Models

- **Finite Automata**: Limited to finite memory, they recognize regular languages (e.g., simple patterns). Why can’t they match TMs? Their memory constraints restrict their power.
- **Pushdown Automata**: Use a stack for memory, recognizing context-free languages (e.g., nested parentheses). They’re more powerful than finite automata but less than TMs.
- **Turing Machines**: With an infinite tape, TMs can recognize **recursively enumerable languages**, making them the most powerful model. What does this imply? Any computable function can be implemented on a TM.

## 1.2 Formalism of Deterministic Turing Machines

### Components of a Deterministic Turing Machine (DTM)

A DTM is defined by:

- **States** ($Q$): A finite set of control states.
- **Input Alphabet** ($\Sigma$): Symbols the machine reads.
- **Tape Alphabet** ($\Gamma$, where $\Sigma \subseteq \Gamma$): Includes input symbols and additional symbols like blanks ($\sqcup$).
- **Transition Function** ($\delta: Q \times \Gamma \rightarrow Q \times \Gamma \times \{L, R\}$): Specifies the next state, symbol to write, and head movement (left or right).
- **Start State** ($q_0 \in Q$): Where computation begins.
- **Accept States** ($F \subseteq Q$): Indicate successful computation.
- **Reject States** ($R \subseteq Q$): Indicate failure.
  The tape is infinite, initially holding the input with blank symbols elsewhere. What’s the role of each component? They work together to process the input systematically.

### Operation of a DTM

The DTM starts in $q_0$, with the head on the leftmost input symbol. At each step:

- Reads the current symbol.
- Applies $\delta$ to determine the new state, symbol to write, and head movement.
- Continues until reaching an accept or reject state, or loops indefinitely.
  How does this mimic real computation? It’s like a program executing instructions step-by-step.

### Configurations and Halting

A **configuration** captures the machine’s state, tape contents, and head position, denoted as $\langle q, w, i \rangle$. The machine **halts** when it enters an accept or reject state or if no transition is defined. Why track configurations? They help analyze the machine’s behavior over time.

## 1.3 Variants of Turing Machines

### Multiple-Tape Turing Machines

**Multi-tape TMs** have multiple tapes, each with its own head, allowing parallel processing. For example, a two-tape TM can check palindromes in $O(n)$ time by copying the input to a second tape and comparing symbols from both ends. Can they do more than single-tape TMs? No, but they’re often more efficient. A single-tape TM can simulate a $k$-tape TM, but with a time complexity increase from $O(t(n))$ to $O(t(n)^2)$.

### Non-Deterministic Turing Machines (NTMs)

**NTMs** allow multiple possible transitions for a given state and symbol, accepting if any path leads to an accept state. They’re theoretically as powerful as DTMs but can be exponentially slower when simulated, with time complexity growing from $O(t(n))$ to $2^{O(t(n))}$. Why study NTMs? They model parallel computation and are relevant in complexity theory.

## 1.4 Algorithms and Deciders

### Definition of an Algorithm

An **algorithm** is a TM that always halts, called a **decider**. It provides a definitive yes/no answer for a decision problem. What makes this definition powerful? It formalizes the concept of computation.

### Turing-Decidable Languages

A language is **Turing-decidable** if a decider TM accepts all strings in the language and rejects others. Examples include checking if a string has an even number of zeros or is a palindrome.

### Example: Even Number of Zeros

Consider a TM that checks if a binary string has an even number of zeros:

- **States**: $\{q*0, q_1, q*{\text{accept}}, q\_{\text{reject}}\}$.
- **Input Alphabet**: $\{0, 1\}$.
- **Tape Alphabet**: $\{0, 1, \vdash, \sqcup\}$.
- **Transition Function**:
  - In $q_0$, reading 0: Move to $q_1$, write $\sqcup$, move right.
  - In $q_0$, reading 1: Stay in $q_0$, write $\sqcup$, move right.
  - In $q_1$, reading 0: Move to $q_0$, write $\sqcup$, move right.
  - In $q_1$, reading 1: Stay in $q_1$, write $\sqcup$, move right.
  - In $q_0$, reading $\sqcup$: Accept.
  - In $q_1$, reading $\sqcup$: Reject.
    For input “00010” (four 0s), the TM toggles states and accepts, confirming an even count. How does this work? It tracks parity by switching states for each 0.

## 1.5 Computational Complexity

### Time Complexity

**Time complexity** measures the number of steps a TM takes, expressed using **Big-O** notation. For example, a single-tape TM checking palindromes takes $O(n^2)$ steps due to repeated tape traversals.

### Space Complexity

**Space complexity** measures the tape cells used. Most TMs use at least $O(n)$ space for the input, but some problems require more.

### Example: Palindrome Checking

- **Single-Tape TM**: Marks the first and last symbols, moving the head back and forth, requiring $O(n^2)$ time. Why so slow? The head must traverse the tape repeatedly.
- **Two-Tape TM**: Copies the input to a second tape, compares symbols in $O(n)$ time. This efficiency highlights the advantage of multi-tape TMs.

## 1.6 Decision Problems

### Definition

A **decision problem** asks for a yes/no answer, like “Is this string a palindrome?” The language is the set of strings for which the answer is yes.

### Relationship with TMs

TMs solve decision problems by accepting or rejecting inputs. For example, the palindrome problem is decidable because a TM can check it in finite time.

## 1.7 Theoretical Results

### Church-Turing Thesis

The **Church-Turing Thesis** states that any function computable by an effective method can be computed by a TM. Why is this significant? It equates TMs with the concept of computation itself.

### Equivalence of TM Variants

All TM variants (single-tape, multi-tape, non-deterministic) recognize the same languages, but their efficiency differs. For instance, simulating a multi-tape TM on a single-tape TM incurs a quadratic time penalty.

## 1.8 Examples and Proofs

### TM for Even Number of Zeros

The TM described in 4.3 processes input like “00010” by toggling between $q_0$ (even) and $q_1$ (odd) for each 0, accepting if it ends in $q_0$. This illustrates state-based computation.

### TM for Palindrome Checking

- **Single-Tape**: Overwrites the first and last symbols with a marker ($u$), checks if they match, and repeats inward. Time complexity is $O(n^2)$.
- **Two-Tape**: Copies the input, compares symbols from both ends in $O(n)$ time, showcasing multi-tape efficiency.

### Proofs

- **Multi-Tape Simulation**: A single-tape TM simulates a $k$-tape TM by encoding all tapes on one, with a quadratic time increase.
- **Crossing Sequences**: Used to prove that palindrome checking on a single-tape TM requires at least $O(n^2)$ time, due to the need to cross the tape multiple times.

## Summary of Application Layer Concepts

- **Application Layer Overview**:
  - Consists of network applications and application-layer protocols.
  - Operates exclusively on end hosts, not on routers or switches.

- **Sockets and Transport Layer**:
  - Sockets provide an API for data transmission and reception via transport layer protocols like UDP or TCP.

- **HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP)**:
  - Facilitates communication between web clients and servers.
  - Utilises TCP for reliable end-to-end communication.
  - HTTP requests fetch web pages and objects, while responses transfer objects back to the client.
  - Features like persistent connections and pipelining reduce latency.
  - HTTP/2 enhances performance with multiplexing, prioritisation, push, and compression.

- **Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)**:
  - Enables communication between mail servers.
  - Push-based protocol for transmitting email messages to the recipient's mail server.
  - Requires other protocols like HTTP or IMAP to retrieve email from the server's mailbox.

- **Domain Name System (DNS)**:
  - Maps human-readable hostnames to router-readable IP addresses.
  - Relies on a hierarchy of DNS servers.
  - Provides aliasing and load distribution functionality.

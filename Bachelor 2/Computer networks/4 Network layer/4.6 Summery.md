- The Internet's network layer is best-effort and provides addressing (using IPv4 or IPv6)

- Every router performs forwarding (data plane) based on a forwarding table populated by a routing algorithm (control plane)

- Router queueing can occur both at the input and output ports
	- Queuing policies: First-in-first-out (FIFO), priority queuing, weighted fair queuing (and round robin)

- IPv4 uses 32-bit addresses, while IPv6 uses 128-bit addresses
	- Each IP address has a network prefix and a host identifier (marked using the subnet mask /x notation)
	- DHCP automatically assigns IP addresses, and discovers the default gateway, subnet mask, and local DNS server
	- NAT is used to translate between public and private IP addresses

- Routing algorithms determine the path from the source to destination host in a network
	- Centralized (link-state) vs. distribution (distance vector) routing
	- The Internet splits routing in two levels: within and between autonomous systems (ASs)
	- Several algorithms exist for intra-AS routing, such as OSPF (based on the link-state method)
	- Inter-AS routing is done using BGP, which is based on distance-vectors

- SDN supports more fine-grained packet processing, using multi-header matching rules and flexible actions

- The contents of this part is covered in the book in Sections 4.1â€”4.4 and 5.2-5.5

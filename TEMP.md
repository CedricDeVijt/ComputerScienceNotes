## 1.1 Introduction to Turing Machines

This chapter introduces Turing Machines (TMs) as a fundamental model for computation, formalizing the concept of algorithms and their implementation. TMs extend beyond simpler models like finite and pushdown automata, offering a robust framework to simulate general-purpose computers. Why are TMs considered a universal model? Their ability to implement any known algorithm and simulate other computational models efficiently makes them central to theoretical computer science.

### Evolution from Simpler Models

Finite automata and pushdown automata, covered in prior courses, model machines with limited memory. **Finite automata** handle regular languages with bounded memory, while **pushdown automata** use a stack for infinite memory, supporting context-free grammars. However, these models are too restrictive for general computation. How do TMs overcome these limitations? They introduce an infinite tape and flexible read/write operations, enabling complex computations.

#### Limitations of Prior Models

- **Finite Automata**: Restricted to regular languages, unable to handle computations requiring memory beyond a fixed state set (e.g., cannot count arbitrary sequences).
- **Pushdown Automata**: Limited to stack-based memory, insufficient for tasks requiring arbitrary data manipulation, like simulating a full programming language.
  ↗ See Section 2.1 for how TMs address these restrictions.

### The Church-Turing Thesis

The **Church-Turing Thesis** posits that any algorithm can be implemented by a Turing Machine, equating TMs to the concept of computation itself. Why is this significant? It establishes TMs as a universal model, where any program executable on a modern computer can be expressed as a TM, and vice versa. This thesis underpins the equivalence of TMs with other formalisms, like lambda calculus, in computational power.

#### Implications for Computation

- All known algorithms can be implemented by TMs.
- TMs can simulate any other computational model efficiently, reinforcing their role as a standard for studying computability (e.g., reducing other models to TMs).

## 1.2 Core Components and Operation of Turing Machines

This chapter details the structure and mechanics of deterministic Turing Machines, focusing on their components and operational principles. TMs consist of a finite control, an infinite tape, and a read/write head, enabling dynamic computation. How do these components interact to perform computations? The machine transitions between states, reading and writing symbols on the tape based on a defined transition function.

### Formal Definition of a Turing Machine

A deterministic TM is defined by the tuple $M = (Q, \Sigma, \Gamma, \delta, q*0, q*{\text{accept}}, q\_{\text{reject}})$, where:

- $Q$: Finite set of **states**.
- $\Sigma$: **Input alphabet**, excluding special symbols $\vdash, \sqcup$.
- $\Gamma$: **Tape alphabet**, where $\Sigma \cup \{\vdash, \sqcup\} \subseteq \Gamma$.
- $\delta$: **Transition function**, $\delta: Q \times \Gamma \rightarrow Q \times \Gamma \times \{\leftarrow, \square, \rightarrow\}$, dictating state changes, symbol writes, and head movements.
- $q_0$: Initial state.
- $q*{\text{accept}}, q*{\text{reject}}$: Halting states for accepting or rejecting input.
  What ensures a TM’s computation is well-defined? The transition function and tape constraints (e.g., not overwriting $\vdash$) maintain consistent behavior.

#### Tape and Symbol Constraints

- The tape is infinite to the right, with $\vdash$ marking position 0.
- The head cannot move left of $\vdash$ or overwrite it, ensuring the tape’s start is preserved.
- Blank symbols ($\sqcup$) fill positions beyond the input, allowing indefinite expansion.

### Configurations and Transitions

A TM’s **configuration** captures its state, tape contents, and head position, represented as $C = \vdash u q v$, where $u, v \in \Gamma^*$, $q \in Q$, and the head is at the first symbol of $v$. Transitions follow the rule:

- For $\delta(q_i, b) = (q_j, c, D)$, configuration $\vdash u a q_i b v$ yields:
  - $\vdash u q_j a c v$ if $D = \leftarrow$.
  - $\vdash u a c q_j v$ if $D = \square$.
  - $\vdash u a q_j c v$ if $D = \rightarrow$.
    How does this drive computation? Each step updates the configuration, progressing toward a halting state or continuing indefinitely.

#### Example Configuration

- For tape $\vdash 101001$, state $q$, head at position 4, the configuration is $\vdash 101 q 001$.
- If $\delta(q, 0) = (q', 1, \rightarrow)$, the next configuration is $\vdash 1011 q' 01$.
  ↗ See Section 3.2 for a practical example of a TM run.

### Computation Process

Computation begins with the **start configuration** $\vdash q*0 w$, where $w \in \Sigma^*$ is the input. The TM applies transitions until reaching an **accepting configuration** ($\vdash q*{\text{accept}}$) or **rejecting configuration** ($\vdash q\_{\text{reject}}$). What happens if a TM doesn’t halt? It may loop indefinitely, a key consideration in computability analysis.

#### Halting and Non-Halting Behavior

- **Accepting**: The TM reaches $q\_{\text{accept}}$, indicating the input is in the language $L(M)$.
- **Rejecting**: The TM reaches $q\_{\text{reject}}$, indicating the input is not in $L(M)$.
- **Non-Halting**: The TM continues without entering a halting state, common in undecidable problems.

## 1.3 Practical Example: Even Number of Zeros

This chapter illustrates a TM designed to check if a binary string has an even number of zeros, demonstrating how TMs process inputs systematically. The TM scans the tape, marking zeros to track parity, and accepts or rejects based on the final count. Why is this example useful? It showcases state transitions and tape manipulation in a concrete decision problem.

### TM Specification

Consider the TM $M = (Q, \Sigma, \Gamma, \delta, q*0, q*{\text{accept}}, q\_{\text{reject}})$:

- $Q = \{q*0, q_1, q*{\text{accept}}, q\_{\text{reject}}\}$.
- $\Sigma = \{0, 1\}$.
- $\Gamma = \{0, 1, \vdash, \sqcup\}$.
- Transition function $\delta$:
  - $\delta(q_0, 0) = (q_1, \sqcup, \rightarrow)$: On 0, switch to $q_1$, erase, move right.
  - $\delta(q_0, 1) = (q_0, \sqcup, \rightarrow)$: On 1, stay in $q_0$, erase, move right.
  - $\delta(q_1, 0) = (q_0, \sqcup, \rightarrow)$: On 0, switch to $q_0$, erase, move right.
  - $\delta(q_1, 1) = (q_1, \sqcup, \rightarrow)$: On 1, stay in $q_1$, erase, move right.
  - $\delta(q*0, \sqcup) = (q*{\text{accept}}, \sqcup, \rightarrow)$: On blank, accept if in $q_0$.
  - $\delta(q*1, \sqcup) = (q*{\text{reject}}, \sqcup, \rightarrow)$: On blank, reject if in $q_1$.
    How does this TM determine parity? It toggles between $q_0$ (even zeros) and $q_1$ (odd zeros), accepting if the final state is $q_0$.

#### Run Example

- Input $w = 00010$:
  - Step 1: $\vdash q_0 00010$.
  - Step 2: $\vdash \sqcup q_1 0010$ ($\delta(q_0, 0)$).
  - Step 3: $\vdash \sqcup \sqcup q_0 010$ ($\delta(q_1, 0)$).
  - Step 4: $\vdash \sqcup \sqcup \sqcup q_1 10$ ($\delta(q_0, 0)$).
  - Step 5: $\vdash \sqcup \sqcup \sqcup \sqcup q_1 0$ ($\delta(q_1, 1)$).
  - Step 6: $\vdash \sqcup \sqcup \sqcup \sqcup \sqcup q_0$ ($\delta(q_1, 0)$).
  - Step 7: $\vdash \sqcup \sqcup \sqcup \sqcup \sqcup q\_{\text{accept}}$ ($\delta(q_0, \sqcup)$).
- Result: Accepts (four zeros, even).

## 1.4 Time Complexity and Asymptotic Analysis

This chapter explores how TMs are analyzed for efficiency using time complexity and asymptotic notation, crucial for comparing computational models. Time complexity measures the number of steps a TM takes, while asymptotic analysis provides a scalable way to evaluate performance. Why is this important? It helps quantify the efficiency of algorithms across different TM variants.

### Worst-Case Time Complexity

The **time complexity** of a TM $M$, denoted $t_M(n)$, is the maximum number of steps taken on any input of length $n$:
$$t_M(n) = \max \{\text{time}\_M(w) \mid w \in \Sigma^*, |w| = n\}$$
A TM runs in time $O(t(n))$ if $t_M(n)$ is of order $O(t(n))$. What does this reveal? It highlights the worst-case scenario, critical for understanding computational limits.

#### Asymptotic Notation

- **Big-O**: $f(n) = O(g(n))$ if $f(n) \leq c \cdot g(n)$ for some constant $c$ and large $n$.
- Used to bound the growth rate of $t_M(n)$, ignoring constants (e.g., $O(n^2)$ for quadratic time).
  ↗ See Section 6.3 for complexity differences in multi-tape TMs.

### Crossing Sequences and Palindrome Example

**Crossing sequences** track state transitions at specific tape positions, used to prove time lower bounds. For the language $L_n = \{ w \#^n w^R \mid w \in \{0,1\}^n \}$, a 1-tape TM requires $\Omega(n^2)$ time to recognize palindromes. Why? The machine must cross the tape multiple times to compare $w$ and $w^R$, generating $\Omega(n)$-length crossing sequences over $\frac{n}{2}$ positions.

#### Proof Outline

- If $C_i(w_1) = C_j(w_2)$, the concatenated word $w_1' w_2'$ is accepted, but may not be a palindrome if $w_1 \neq w_2$.
- The number of distinct crossing sequences ($2^n$) implies a minimum sequence length of $\Omega(n)$, leading to $\Omega(n^2)$ steps.
- Conclusion: 1-tape TMs cannot recognize palindromes in linear time.

## 1.5 Variants of Turing Machines

This chapter examines extensions of TMs, including multi-tape and non-deterministic variants, and their impact on computational power and efficiency. While all variants accept the same languages, their time complexities differ significantly. How do these variants enhance computation? They offer practical advantages in simulating complex algorithms.

### Multi-Tape Turing Machines

A **multi-tape TM** has multiple tapes, each with its own read/write head, controlled by a single finite control. The transition function is:
$$\delta: Q \times \Gamma^k \rightarrow Q \times \Gamma^k \times \{\leftarrow, \square, \rightarrow\}^k$$
where $k$ is the number of tapes. Why use multiple tapes? They simplify tasks like copying or comparing strings, reducing time complexity.

#### Simulation by 1-Tape TM

- A 1-tape TM can simulate a $k$-tape TM by encoding all tapes into a single tape with delimiters, but incurs a quadratic slowdown: $O(t(n)^2)$ for a $k$-tape TM running in $O(t(n))$.
- Example: A 2-tape TM checks palindromes in $O(n)$, but a 1-tape TM requires $O(n^2)$.
  ↗ See Section 4.2 for palindrome complexity analysis.

### Non-Deterministic Turing Machines

A **non-deterministic TM (NTM)** allows multiple possible transitions, defined by a relation:
$$\delta \subseteq Q \times \Gamma \times Q \times \Gamma \times \{\leftarrow, \square, \rightarrow\}$$
An NTM accepts a word if at least one computation path reaches $q\_{\text{accept}}$. What’s the advantage? NTMs can “guess” solutions, potentially reducing steps for decision problems.

#### Formal Definition and Operation

- An NTM’s configuration transitions are non-deterministic, e.g., for state $q$, symbol $a$, possible transitions include $(q, a, q', b, \square)$ or $(q, a, q'', a, \rightarrow)$.
- The **computation tree** represents all possible runs, with acceptance if any path reaches $q\_{\text{accept}}$.

#### Simulation by Deterministic TM

- A deterministic TM simulates an NTM using a 3-tape approach (input, simulation, branch tracking) via **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** to explore the computation tree.
- If an NTM runs in $O(t(n))$, the deterministic TM runs in $2^{O(t(n))}$, an exponential blowup.
- Why BFS? Depth-First Search risks infinite loops if the NTM isn’t a decider.

#### Complexity Analysis

- For an NTM with $b$ choices per step, the number of branches is $O(b^{t(n)})$.
- Total simulation time: $O(t(n) b^{t(n)}) = 2^{O(t(n))}$.
- Open question: Can this exponential blowup be avoided?
  ↗ See Section 6.3 for decider definitions.

## 1.6 Algorithms and Deciders

This chapter defines TMs as algorithms and deciders, focusing on their role in solving decision problems. A TM is a **decider** if it halts on all inputs, ensuring a definitive accept or reject outcome. Why is this distinction critical? It separates computable problems from those that may loop indefinitely.

### Deterministic Algorithms

A **deterministic TM** that halts on all inputs is a decider, implementing an algorithm for a decision problem. The language $L(M) = \{ w \in \Sigma^\* \mid M \text{ accepts } w \}$ defines the problem solved. How is time complexity measured? It’s the maximum steps over all inputs of length $n$.

#### Example: Even Zeros TM

- The TM from Section 3 is a decider, halting on all binary strings and accepting those with even zeros.
- Time complexity: $O(n)$, as it scans the tape once.

### Non-Deterministic Algorithms

A **non-deterministic TM** is a decider if every computation path halts. It accepts a word if any path reaches $q\_{\text{accept}}$. Why is non-determinism powerful? It allows exploring multiple solutions simultaneously, useful in problems like satisfiability.

#### Time Complexity of NTMs

- Time complexity $t_M(n)$: Maximum steps across all paths for inputs of length $n$.
- An NTM runs in $O(t(n))$ if $t_M(n) = O(t(n))$.
- Example: An NTM guessing a palindrome’s midpoint could reduce steps compared to a deterministic TM’s sequential comparison.

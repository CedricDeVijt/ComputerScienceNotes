This note provides an overview of the topics covered in the Compilers course, focusing on the second lecture titled "Regular and context-free tools (abridged)". The lecture covers the fundamentals of scanning, building scanners, recognising vs. scanning, and the Fast Lexical Analyzer Generator (Flex). It also introduces the concepts of grammars, formalising derivations, types of grammars, Chomsky's Hierarchy, context-free languages, attribute grammars, pushdown automata, and deterministic pushdown automata. The lecture concludes by summarizing the key takeaways from the material.

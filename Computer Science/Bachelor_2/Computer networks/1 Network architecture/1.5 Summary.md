- The Internet evolved from a network of 4 computers in 1967 to a network of networks containing billions of devices
- It consists of a layered hierarchy of Internet Service Providers (ISPs), together forming a global network connecting all hosts
- It mostly makes use of packet switching, which is more efficient and simple, but less predictable than circuit switching
- Network performance is characterised in terms of delay, packet loss and throughput
- A protocol defines the format and order of messages exchanged between hosts, and actions taken upon receiving/transmitting these messages
- The Internet protocol stack consists of 5 layers (application, transport, network, link, and physical), each encapsulating messages with their own headers

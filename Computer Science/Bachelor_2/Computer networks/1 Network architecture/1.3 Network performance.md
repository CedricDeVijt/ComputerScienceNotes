## 1.3.1 Types of Delays in Packet Switching
### **Processing Delay**
- *Definition*: Time to examine packet header and determine packet's route.
- *Includes*: Checking for bit-level errors.
- *Duration*: Typically microseconds or less in high-speed routers.
### **Queuing Delay**
- *Definition*: Delay as packet waits in queue to be transmitted.
- *Dependent on*: Number of earlier-arriving packets in the queue.
- *Intensity of traffic*: Determines length of queuing delay.
- *Duration*: Microseconds to milliseconds in practice.
### **Transmission Delay**
- *Definition*: Time to transmit packet's bits onto the link.
- *Formula*: $\frac{L}{R}$, where $L$ is packet length (in bits) and $R$ is transmission rate (in bits/sec).
- *Duration*: Microseconds to milliseconds in practice.
### **Propagation Delay**
- *Definition*: Time for a bit to propagate from one node to another.
- *Dependent on*: Distance between nodes and propagation speed of the link.
- *Propagation speed*: Typically 2 x 10^8 to 3 x 10^8 meters/sec.
- *Duration*: Milliseconds in wide-area networks.

Understanding these delays is crucial for evaluating and optimising the performance of Internet applications.

## 1.3.2 End-to-End Delay in Computer Networks
The end-to-end delay in a computer network can be understood by considering the cumulative delay experienced across all routers from the source to the destination. 
### Equation for End-to-End Delay
- $d_{end-to-end} = N \left( d_{proc} + d_{trans} + d_{prop} \right)$
  - $d_{trans} = \frac{L}{R}$, where $L$ is packet size.
### Traceroute Program
- **Function**: Provides insight into end-to-end delay by tracing the route of packets from source to destination.
- **Operation**:
  - Sends special packets toward destination.
  - Each router encountered sends back a message to the source containing its name and address.
  - Source records time elapsed for each packet and the returning router's information.
- **Repetition**: Repeats the process three times for reliability.
- **Variability**: Queuing delay variations may cause round-trip delays to differ between successive packets sent to different routers.

Traceroute enables network diagnosis by revealing the path taken by packets and measuring round-trip delays to routers.

## 1.3.3 End-to-End Throughput in Computer Networks

End-to-end throughput is a critical performance measure in computer networks, alongside delay and packet loss. It refers to the rate at which data is successfully transferred from a source to a destination over the network. Let's delve into the concept of throughput with some examples.
### Definition of Throughput
- **Instantaneous Throughput**: The rate at which the destination host is receiving data at any given moment.
- **Average Throughput**: The average rate at which data is transferred over the entire duration of the transfer.
  - Calculated as $\frac{F}{T}$ bits/sec, where $F$ is the size of the file (in bits) and $T$ is the time taken for the transfer (in seconds).
### Importance of Throughput
- **Applications**: Critical for various applications, e.g., Internet telephony and real-time video, which require consistent throughput above certain thresholds.
- **File Transfers**: For file transfers, high throughput is desirable even if delay is not critical.

Throughput provides insights into the effective data transfer rate in a network, crucial for assessing performance and optimising network resources.

## 1.3.4 Throughput in Different Network Scenarios
### Access Network Bottleneck
- **Single-Server, Single-Client**:
  - If the server and client are connected to the network via access links with rates $Rs$ and $Rc$ respectively, and the core network has high-speed links, throughput is constrained by the slower access link.
  - Throughput: $\min(Rs, Rc)$
### Core Network Bottleneck
- **Multiple Servers, Multiple Clients**:
  - When multiple downloads are simultaneous, each involving different client-server pairs, and they share a common link in the core.
  - If the transmission rate of the common link ($R$) is significantly higher than $Rs$ and $Rc$, throughput for each download is $\min(Rs, Rc)$.
	  - If R is comparable to $Rs$ and $Rc$, the shared core link becomes the bottleneck.

### Dependency on Link Transmission Rates
- **General Observation**:
  - Throughput depends on the transmission rates of links along the path and the presence of intervening traffic.
  - A high-speed link may still be a bottleneck if it carries significant traffic from multiple sources.

Throughput analysis helps in understanding network performance under different scenarios, highlighting the impact of link capacities and traffic distribution on data transfer rates.

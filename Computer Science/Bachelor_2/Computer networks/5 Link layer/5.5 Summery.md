-  Link-layer is responsible for transferring data across a single link
-  Functionality can include framing, link access, reliability, and error detection/correction
-  Different methods can be used for error detection: parity checks, checksums, and cyclic redundancy checks (CRC)
-  Multiple access protocols are used to avoid collisions on broadcast links

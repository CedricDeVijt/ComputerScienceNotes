- The transport layer provides a logical end-to-end connection between processes
	- (De)multiplexing uses port numbers and IP addresses to associate packets with processes
	- Bit errors in received packets are detected using a checksum header field

- UDP is a "bare bones" transport protocol that does not provide any additional functionality

- TCP offers additional features, such as reliability, congestion control and flow control
	- Reliability is achieved by combining acknowledgments, timers, retransmissions and sequence numbers
	- TCP estimates the RTT to properly configure the retransmission timeout
	- Flow control allows the receiver to limit the transmission rate using the receive window header field
	- TCP adapts its congestion window when a timeout occurs or it receives three duplicate ACKs
	- The contents of this part is covered in the book in Sections 3.1 - 3.7

**1.4 Protocol layers**

Protocols in computer networks involve hardware or software components of devices exchanging messages and taking actions

  

All activity in the Internet that involves two or more communicating remote entities is governed by a protocol

  

When a request is made to a Web server, the client computer sends a connection request message to the Web server and waits for a reply

The Web server returns a connection reply message, and the client computer then sends the name of the Web page it wants to fetch from the Web server in a GET message

Finally, the Web server returns the Web page (file) to the client computer

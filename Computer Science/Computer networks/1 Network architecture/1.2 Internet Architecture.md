1.2.1 High-level view of the Internet’s architecture

End systems: devices or nodes at the edge of a network that generate and/or consume data

  

Links: the physical or logical connections that enable communication between devices or nodes

  

Packets: units of data that are transmitted over a network. These packets contain both the data being transmitted as well as control information necessary for routing and managing the transmission

  

Packet switching: method used in computer networks to transmit data in the form of packets

  

Packet switches: also known as a router or a switch, is responsible for forwarding data packets from one network segment to another.

  

End systems are connected together by a network of communication links and packet switches

  

Links can transmit data at different rates, with the transmission rate measured in bits/second

  

Route: sequence of communication links and packet switches traversed by a packet

  

Link-layer switches are typically used in access networks, routers are typically used in the network core

  

End systems access the Internet through Internet Service Providers (ISPs)

  

ISPs are interconnected through national and international upper-tier ISPs

  

**1.2.2 Access Networks**

Access network: the physically connection between an end system and the first router (edge router) on a path from the end system to any other distant end system

  

LAN (Local Area Network): a network that spans a relatively small area, typically within a single building or campus.

  

WAN (Wide Area Network): a network that spans a large geographical area, connecting multiple LANs or other networks across cities, countries, or even continents

  

**1.2.3 The network core**

Network core: the central part of a computer network where the main communication pathways and infrastructure components are located

  

End systems exchange messages with each other through a network core

  

To send a message from a source end system to a destination end system, the source breaks long messages into smaller chunks of data (packets)

Store-and-forward transmission: method used in networking for transmitting data packets between devices. A node (such as a router or a switch) receives the entire data packet before it begins to forward it to the next node or destination

  

The packet switch must receive the entire packet before it can begin to transmit the first bit of the packet onto the outbound link

  

Calculating the amount of time that elapses from when the source begins to send the packet until the destination has received the entire packet is

L is the length of each link

R is the rate of each link

  

At time L/R seconds, the source has transmitted the entire packet, and the entire packet has been received and stored at the router

At time 2L/R seconds, the router has transmitted the entire packet, and the entire packet has been received by the destination

  

If the switch forwarded bits as soon as they arrive, the total delay would be L/R

However, routers need to receive, store, and process the entire packet before forwarding

End-to-end delay for sending a packet over N links each with rate R

  

Transmission delay: the time it takes for a packet to travel from the source to the first router is L/R

  

Propagation delay: the time the packet waits for (L/R) time before being forwarded to the next router

  

The total waiting time is the sum of the propagation delays at each of the (N-1) routers.

  

Therefore, the end-to-end delay is the sum of the transmission delay and the total waiting time.

  

**1.2.4 Packet switching**

Each packet switch has multiple links attached to it

  

Output buffer: a temporary storage for packets that are waiting to be transmitted out of a particular interface or link

  

Arriving packets wait in the output buffer if the link is busy with another packet transmission

  

Packets suffer variable output buffer queuing delays that depend on the level of congestion in the network

  

If the buffer is full, packet loss occurs

  

Forwarding tables: data structures used by routers to determine the appropriate outbound link or interface to forward incoming packets towards their destination

  

Routing protocols: sets of rules and algorithms used by routers to determine the optimal path for forwarding data packets from a source to a destination across a network

**1.2.5 Circuit switching**

Circuit switching: is a method for data transmission where a dedicated communication path, or circuit, is created between the sender and the receiver

  

Before the sender can send information, the network must establish a connection between the sender and the receiver

  

A constant transmission rate in the network’s links is reserved for the duration of the connection

The sender can transfer the data to the receiver at the guaranteed constant rate

  

**Packet-switched networks vs circuit-switched networks**

In packet-switched networks, resources are not reserved; a session’s messages use the resources on demand and, as a consequence, may have to wait for access to a communication link

  

In circuit-switched networks, resources are reserved for the duration of the communication session between the end systems

  

**1.2.6 Multiplexing multiple circuits over one link**

Frequency-Division Multiplexing (FDM): method to share a transmission medium among multiple communication channels by allocating each channel a different frequency band within the available spectrum.

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

Bandwidth: the range of frequencies or the capacity of a communication channel to transmit data

  

A frequency band is dedicated to each connection for the duration of the connection

  

Time-Division Multiplexing (TDM): method to share a single transmission medium among multiple communication channels by dividing the time into fixed-duration slots

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

Time is divided into frames of fixed duration

  

Each frame is divided into a fixed number of time slots

  

The transmission rate of a circuit is equal to the frame rate multiplied by the number of bits in a slot

  

**1.2.7 Packet switching vs circuit switching**

Critics of packet switching argue that it is not suitable for real-time services such as telephone calls and video conference calls due to variable and unpredictable end-to-end delays caused primarily by queuing delays

  

Proponents of packet switching argue that it offers better sharing of transmission capacity than circuit switching and is simpler, more efficient, and less costly to implement than circuit switching

Current trends in telecommunication networks

  

Both packet switching and circuit switching are prevalent in today’s telecommunication networks

The trend has been in the direction of packet switching

  

Many circuit-switched telephone networks are slowly migrating toward packet switching

  

**1.2.8 The Internet**

Tier 1 Internet Service Providers (ISPs): Global transit ISPs that offer Internet connectivity in many places across the globe

  

Regional ISPs connect to tier-1 ISPs, and access ISPs connect to regional ISPs

  

Points of presence (PoP): a group of one or more routers in the provider’s network where customer ISP's can connect into the provider ISP

  

PoPs exist in all levels of the hierarchy, except for the bottom (access ISP) level

  

Multi-homing: the practice of connecting to multiple upstream provider ISPs. Any ISP (except for tier-1 ISPs) may choose to multi-home

  

When an ISP multi-homes, it can continue to send and receive packets into the Internet even if one of its providers has a failure

  

Content-provider: a network that creates its own data centers with servers to provide online services, bypassing some upper tiers of the Internet.

  

The Internet is a network of networks, consisting of tier-1 ISPs and lower-tier ISPs

Tier-1 ISPs are the top-level networks that interconnect with one another

Lower-tier ISPs connect to higher-tier ISPs and provide services to end users and content providers

  

A content provider can bypass the upper tiers of the Internet by peering with lower-tier ISPs

  

The content provider reduces its payments to upper-tier ISPs

  

The content provider has greater control of how its services are delivered to end users

Diversity of ISPs

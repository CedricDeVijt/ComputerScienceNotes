A packet suffers from several types of delays at each node along the path

  

The most important of these delays are the nodal processing delay, queuing delay, transmission delay, and propagation delay

  

Nodal Processing Delay: the time required to examine the packet’s header and determine where to direct the packet

  

Processing delays in high-speed routers are typically on the order of microseconds or less

  

Queuing Delay: the delay experienced by a packet as it waits in a queue to be transmitted onto a network link

  

Queuing delays can be on the order of microseconds to milliseconds in practice

  

Transmission Delay: the time required to transmit all the bits of a packet into the link between two network nodes

  

Transmission delays are typically on the order of microseconds to milliseconds in practice

  

Propagation Delay: the time it takes for a a packet to travel from one point to another in a network 

  

In wide-area networks, propagation delays are on the order of milliseconds

  

End-to-end Delay: the delay from the source host to the destination host

  

It is calculated as the sum of the processing delay, transmission delay, and propagation delay at each of the N-1 routers between the source and destination hosts

  

**1.3.2 Throughput**

Throughput: the rate (in bits/sec) at which data is successfully delivered from sender to receiver

  

For some applications, it is desirable to have a low delay and a consistent high throughput

  

For other applications, such as file transfers, delay is not critical but high throughput is desirable

Throughput in a Simple Network

  

Throughput is determined by the bottleneck link in the network

  

In a network with two links, the throughput is the minimum of the two link rates

  

Improving the rate of a non-bottleneck link does not increase the throughput

To increase throughput, the rate of the bottleneck link must be improved

  

The throughput depends on the transmission rates of the links along the path and on the intervening traffic

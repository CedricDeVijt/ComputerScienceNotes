## 2.1.1 Application Layer Overview
**End Systems**: Programs running on different end systems communicate over the network.

**Application Layer**: The highest layer of the OSI model where network applications and their respective application-layer protocols are situated.
### Protocols
- **HTTP** (HyperText Transfer Protocol): Facilitates Web document request and transfer.
- **SMTP** (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol): Supports the transfer of email messages.
- **FTP** (File Transfer Protocol): Allows for the transfer of files between two end systems.
- **DNS** (Domain Name System): A specific application-layer protocol responsible for translating human-friendly names for Internet end systems into 32-bit network addresses.
### Communication
- **Application-Layer Protocol**: Distributed across multiple end systems, enabling applications in one system to exchange packets of information (referred to as messages) with applications in other systems.
## 2.1.2 Client-Server Architecture
*Client-Server Architecture*: A network architecture where an always-on host (server) services requests from multiple other hosts (clients).
### Characteristics
- **Server**: Always-on host that responds to client requests.
- **Clients**: Hosts that send requests to the server.
- **Communication**: Clients do not communicate directly with each other.
- **Server Address**: Has a fixed, well-known address (IP address).
### Examples
- Web applications: Web server servicing requests from browsers.
- Applications: Web, FTP, Telnet, and email.
## 2.1.3 Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Architecture
**Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Architecture**: An architecture relying on direct communication between intermittently connected hosts (peers) without dedicated servers.
### Characteristics
- **Peers**: Intermittently connected hosts that communicate directly.
- **Ownership**: Peers are controlled by users, not service providers.
- **Location**: Peers typically reside in homes, universities, and offices.
- **Communication**: Peers communicate without dedicated servers.
### Example
- BitTorrent: A popular file-sharing P2P application.
### Features
- **Self-Scalability**: Peers add service capacity by distributing files to other peers.
- **Cost Effectiveness**: Minimal server infrastructure and bandwidth requirements.
- **Challenges**: Security, performance, and reliability due to decentralisation.
## 2.1.4 Communication between processes

**Process**: A program running within an end system

*Client and Server*: In each pair of communicating processes, one is labeled as the client, and the other as the server.
- **Client**: Initiates communication, such as a browser in the Web application.
- **Server**: Waits to be contacted, like a Web server in the Web application.
### Dual Role in P2P Systems
**Client-Server Duality**: Some applications, like P2P file sharing, allow processes to act as both clients and servers.

*Identification in Sessions* : Despite dual roles, within a specific communication session:
- *Client*: The process initiating communication.
- *Server*: The process waiting to be contacted.
### Socket Communication
- **Message Transmission**: Messages between processes traverse through the network.
- **Socket Interface**: Processes send and receive messages through a software interface called a socket.
- *Socket's Role*: It acts as the interface between the application layer and the transport layer within a host, also serving as the Application Programming Interface (API) for network applications.
### Addressing for Communication
- **Recipient Identification**: To send packets from one process to another, the recipient process needs an address.
- **Information Required**: Two pieces of information are necessary: the host's address (IP address) and an identifier specifying the receiving process in the destination host (port number).
## 2.1.5 Transport layer services
### Understanding Transport-Layer Protocols
- **Transport-Layer Responsibility**: Responsible for delivering messages between sender and receiver sockets.
- **Choosing the Right Protocol**: Based on the application's requirements, you select a suitable protocol.
### Factors in Protocol Selection
- *Reliable Data Transfer*: Ensures correct and complete data delivery despite network issues.
- *Throughput*: Guarantees a specified data rate, vital for consistent performance.
- *Timing*: Ensures timely delivery of data, critical for real-time applications.
- *Security*: Provides confidentiality, integrity, and authentication of data transmission.
## 2.1.6 Transport Layer Protocols and Data Transfer
### Reliable Data Transfer
- **Transport-layer protocol**: A protocol responsible for facilitating communication between devices on a network.
- **Reliable data transfer**: Ensures that data sent from one process to another arrives intact and in order without errors or omissions.
### Loss-Tolerant Applications
- **Loss-tolerant applications**: Applications that can tolerate some amount of data loss without significant impact on functionality or user experience.
- Examples include multimedia applications like conversational audio/video.
### Bandwidth-Sensitive Applications
- **Bandwidth-sensitive applications**: Applications with specific throughput requirements, relying on the available bandwidth for efficient operation.
- Multimedia applications often fall into this category, though some may utilize adaptive coding techniques to adjust to varying throughput levels.
### Elastic Applications
- **Elastic applications**: Applications that can adapt their throughput usage according to the available bandwidth.
- Examples include electronic mail, file transfer, and Web transfers.
- These applications can utilize as much or as little throughput as available, with more throughput generally being preferable.
## 2.1.7 TCP and UDP Transport Protocols
(Part of the transport layer)
### TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) Services
- **Connection-oriented service**:
  - Before application-level messages start to flow, TCP facilitates the exchange of transport-layer control information between client and server through a handshaking procedure.
  - This handshaking phase establishes a full-duplex connection between the sockets of the two processes, enabling simultaneous message exchange.
  - After sending messages, the application must terminate the connection.
- **Reliable data transfer service**:
  - TCP ensures error-free and ordered delivery of all data sent between communicating processes.
  - It guarantees that the stream of bytes passed into a socket by one side of the application is received exactly the same by the receiving socket, with no missing or duplicate bytes.
- **Congestion-control mechanism**:
  - TCP regulates the sending process's rate when network congestion occurs between sender and receiver.
  - It strives to limit each TCP connection to its equitable share of network bandwidth, serving the general welfare of the Internet.
- **Security**:
  - Transport Layer Security (TLS) enhances TCP by providing critical process-to-process security services, including encryption, data integrity, and end-point authentication.
  - TLS is not a separate transport protocol but an enhancement implemented in the application layer.
### UDP (User Datagram Protocol) Services
- **No-frills, lightweight transport protocol**:
  - UDP offers minimal services and is connectionless, requiring no handshaking before processes start communicating.
- **Unreliable data transfer service**:
  - Messages sent via UDP sockets have no guarantee of reaching the receiver, and those that do may arrive out of order.
- **Lack of congestion control**:
  - UDP does not incorporate a congestion-control mechanism, allowing the sending side to transmit data at any rate desired.
### Services Not Provided by the Internet
- Reliable data transfer, throughput, timing, and security:
  - TCP provides reliable end-to-end data transfer and can be enhanced with TLS for security.
  - However, neither TCP nor UDP offers throughput or timing guarantees, which are not provided by current Internet transport protocols.
- Challenges for time-sensitive applications:
  - Time-sensitive applications, like Internet telephony, have been hosted on the Internet for years.
  - These applications cope with the lack of guarantees through clever design, but limitations arise with excessive delay or limited end-to-end throughput.
## Transport Protocols for Internet Applications
### TCP Usage
- **E-mail, Remote Terminal Access, Web, and File Transfer**: These applications utilize TCP due to its reliable data transfer capability, ensuring that all data reaches its destination eventually.
### UDP Preference for Internet Telephony
- **Internet Telephony Applications (e.g., Skype)**: Developers often prefer UDP for its ability to tolerate some loss while requiring a minimal effective rate. This circumvents TCP's congestion control mechanism and packet overheads. However, if UDP communication fails due to firewall configurations, these applications resort to TCP as a backup.
## 2.1.8 Application-Layer Protocols
### Message Structure and Meaning
- **Structure of Messages**: Application-layer protocols define how messages are structured, including the types of messages exchanged (e.g., request and response messages), the syntax of message types (fields and delineation), and the semantics of fields (meaning of information).
- **Message Timing**: These protocols also establish rules for when and how processes send and respond to messages.
### Public and Proprietary Protocols
- **Public Domain Protocols**: Some protocols, like HTTP 1.1 (RFC 7230), are specified in RFCs and are publicly available. Adherence to these standards allows interoperability between different implementations. For instance, browsers following the HTTP RFC can retrieve web pages from compliant web servers.
- **Proprietary Protocols**: Many other application-layer protocols, such as those used by Skype, are proprietary and intentionally kept private, not available in the public domain.

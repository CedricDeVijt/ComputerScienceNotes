## 4.3.1 Introduction
### Introduction to Routing Algorithms
- **Routing Algorithms**: Algorithms designed to determine efficient paths from senders to receivers through a network of routers.
- **Good Paths**: Paths with the least cost are considered "good" paths in routing algorithms.
- **Real-World Concerns**: Besides cost, real-world concerns such as policy issues also influence routing decisions.
### Graph Formulation
- **Graph Representation**: Utilisation of a graph to formulate routing problems.
- **Graph Components**: Consists of nodes (representing routers) and edges (representing physical links).
- **Abstraction**: The graph abstraction simplifies the representation of a computer network.
### Edge Costs and Connectivity
- **Edge Costs**: Each edge in the graph has a cost associated with it, reflecting various factors such as physical length, link speed, or monetary cost.
- **Cost Representation**: Denoted as c(x, y), representing the cost between nodes x and y.
- **Neighbour Nodes**: A node y is considered a neighbour of node x if there exists an edge between them.
### Path Finding
- **Goal of Routing Algorithm**: Identify the least costly paths between sources and destinations.
- **Path Definition**: A sequence of nodes constituting a path, with edge costs summed to determine the total cost.
- **Least-Cost Path**: Finding a path with the least total cost from source to destination.
- **Relation to Shortest Path**: When all edge costs are equal, the least-cost path coincides with the shortest path in terms of the number of links.


## 4.3.2 Classification of Routing Algorithms
### Centralised vs. Decentralised Routing

- **Centralised Routing Algorithm**:
  - Utilises complete, global knowledge about the network.
  - Computes least-cost paths from source to destination.
  - Can be executed at a single site or in the routing component of each router.
  - Often referred to as link-state (LS) algorithms.
  
- **Decentralised Routing Algorithm**:
  - Least-cost path calculation is iterative and distributed among routers.
  - No node possesses complete information about all network links.
  - Each node starts with knowledge of its directly attached links.
  - Utilises interactive message exchange between neighbouring routers.
  - Example: Distance-vector (DV) algorithms maintain estimates of costs to other nodes.
### Static vs. Dynamic Routing

- **Static Routing Algorithms**:
  - Routes change slowly, often due to human intervention.
  - Changes typically occur as a result of manual adjustments to link costs.
  
- **Dynamic Routing Algorithms**:
  - Routing paths adapt to network traffic loads or topology changes.
  - Changes may be periodic or in direct response to topology or cost variations.
  - More responsive to network changes but susceptible to issues like routing loops.
### Load-Sensitive vs. Load-Insensitive Routing

- **Load-Sensitive Algorithm**:
  - Link costs dynamically adjust based on congestion levels.
  - Higher costs for congested links, leading to route selection around congestion.
  - Early ARPAnet algorithms were load-sensitive but faced challenges.

- **Load-Insensitive Algorithm**:
  - Link costs do not directly reflect current or recent congestion levels.
  - Examples include modern Internet routing protocols like RIP, OSPF, and BGP.

## 4.3.3 Link-State Routing Algorithm

### Broadcasting Link-State Packets
- **Network Knowledge**:
  - In a link-state algorithm, the entire network topology and all link costs are known.
  - Achieved by broadcasting link-state packets containing link identities and costs to all nodes.
  - Each node receives these packets, resulting in all nodes having an identical view of the network.
### Dijkstra's Algorithm (CHECK WHAT TO KNOW)
- **Algorithm Overview**:
  - Named after its inventor, Dijkstra's algorithm computes the least-cost path from a source node (denoted as u) to all other nodes.
  - Iterative in nature, revealing least-cost paths to destination nodes with each iteration.
  - At the k$^{th}$ iteration, least-cost paths to k destination nodes are known, with the k smallest costs among all destination nodes.

- **Notation**:
  - **D(v)**: Cost of the least-cost path from the source node to destination v in the current iteration.
  - **p(v)**: Previous node (neighbour of v) along the current least-cost path from the source to v.
  - **N'**: Subset of nodes; v is in N' if the least-cost path from the source to v is definitively known.
### Centralised Routing Algorithm
- **Initialisation and Loop**:
  - Begins with an initialisation step followed by a loop executed a number of times equal to the number of nodes in the network.
  - Upon termination, the algorithm calculates the shortest paths from the source node u to every other node in the network.

## 4.3.4 Distance-Vector (DV) Algorithm
### Characteristics

- **Global vs. Distributed**:
  - Unlike the LS algorithm, DV algorithm is distributed.
  - Each node communicates with its directly attached neighbors, performs calculations, and shares results iteratively.
  
- **Iterative and Asynchronous**:
  - Iterative: The process continues until no more information exchange occurs between neighbors.
  - Asynchronous: Nodes do not need to operate synchronously with each other.
### Bellman-Ford Equation

- **Relationship of Least Costs**:
  - Define dx(y) as the cost of the least-cost path from node x to node y.
  - Bellman-Ford equation: $dx(y) = min_v(c(x, v) + dv(y))$, where $min_v$ is taken over all of x’s neighbors.
  - Intuitively, after traveling from x to v, the least-cost path from v to y adds up to the path cost.
### Practical Significance

- **Forwarding Table Entries**:
  - Solution to the Bellman-Ford equation yields entries in node x’s forwarding table.
  - For any neighbouring node achieving the minimum in the equation (denoted as v*), node x forwards packets destined to node y to v*.

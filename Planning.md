### Study Plan: December 20th, 2024 - January 9th, 2025

#### Key Dates
- **Math Finals**: 
  - December 6th (Exercises)
  - December 7th (Theory)
- **Operating Systems Final**: January 9th

#### Study Goals
- **Discrete Math**: Focus on chapters 4-7, with review time for chapters 1-3.
- **Operating Systems**: Focus on chapters 4-9, with review time for chapters 1-3.

The load for Math will be 50% higher than OS, and less time will be spent on review to allow for more focus on learning new material and integrating exercises into the study sessions.

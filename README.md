Use the follwing prompt:

```
Take the following text and make it such  that it is optimized for study purposes. Use markdown formatting to organize the information into clear chapters and sections. Please include the following:

1. **Summary in Chapters**: Divide the content into logical chapters or sections, using headers (`#`, `##`, `###`) to clearly label each part. Ensure each chapter summary is concise but covers all essential points, so no information that I should have studied is left out. The names of the sections and subsections should reflect the content, donâ€™t use general terms like summary, key concepts, etc.

2. **Key Points to Remember**: At the end, create a bulleted list of key points that highlight the most important concepts and facts.

Ensure the final output is easy to navigate and ready to be used as effective study material and covers all the material.
